Feature Engineering
=

The goal of this assignment is to take the pieces of code that we had from
previous homeworks, but them together, and make them better.

You will build on the *tf-idf guesser* by extracting useful information from
its guesses, generate better features for input into the *pytorch logistic
regression* classifier to do a better job of selecting whether a guess to a
question is correct.

What Can You Do?
-

You can:
* Add features
* Change feature representations
* Exclude training data
* Add training data

What Can't You Do?
-
Remove tf-idf as guesser or logistic regression as buzzer.

How to Turn in Your System
