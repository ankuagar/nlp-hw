# nlp-hw
Homework for NLP course at University of Maryland

Shared Data
==================
The homeworks use the dataset of questions.  You can use the Makefile to download the files:
```cd nlp-hw
make 2018_qanta_train.json
```

Prerequisites
==================
I assume that you have pytorch, sklearn, and nltk installed.  It's easy to do this with [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/pytorch/pytorch).
