Format of the Question
========

You may either write a pyramidal question (like the quiz bowl questions we've
been looking at in the previous homeworks) or non-pyramidal questions
like the questions from the Online Quiz League:

How to describe your question
=========
You should have about a page for each question with the following subsections:
* _Question_: The question you asked
* _Guess_: What answer systems provided
* _Answer_: What the correct answer should be.  Provide sources with citations.  Wikipedia should not be used as a primary source.  Better sources are peer-reviewed articles (JSTOR is your friend and is available from UMD IPs without a fee), newspapers, books (Google books is good), etc.
* _Guess Explanation_: Why did the AI provide the answer that it did?  For the
homework, this can be in general terms (but do make use of concepts like
semantic/syntactic ambiguity that we've covered in class), but for the project
this should be backed up with relevant citations from the NLP literature.
* _Interesting/Notability_: Why would someone find this question interesting
or why would someone want to know the answer to this question?  Use citations
as relevant/necessary.  Possible explanations are: surprisingness (Brian May
from Queen has a PhD), novelty (John Tyler is the earliest former
President of the US with a living grandchild), importance (the Witting
reaction is taught in most organic chemistry classes), or connective (Samuel
Beckett drove Andre the Giant to School).

Use of ChatGPT
========

Just so there are no mixed signals, you're allowed (and encouraged) to use
ChatGPT and other AI tools to check your work.  However, don't try to use them
to generate questions or explanations (it probably won't work).  In general,
adhere to the policy articulated here:
https://2023.aclweb.org/blog/ACL-2023-policy/


Groups
=========

You can work in groups for this assignment, but it doesn't decrease the
workload (e.g., if you're N people, you must submit N questions).  Everyone
will get the same score for their submission, and if late days are used it
will be applied to all members of the group.
