How to describe your question
=========
You should have about a page for each question with the following subsections:
* _Question_: The question you asked
* _Guess_: What answer systems provided
* _Answer_: What the correct answer should be.  Provide sources with citations.  Wikipedia should not be used as a primary source.  Better sources are peer-reviewed articles (JSTOR is your friend and is available from UMD IPs without a fee), newspapers, books (Google books is good), etc.
* _Guess Explanation_: Why did the AI get to 

Groups
=========
You can work in groups for this assignment, but it doesn't decrease the workload (e.g., if you're N people, you must submit N questions).  Everyone will get the same score for their submission.
