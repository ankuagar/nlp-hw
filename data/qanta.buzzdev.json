John Locke's Two Treatises adopts this thinker's notion that each man has two natural inclinations: a natural sociability and an inclination to self-love. This philosopher used a hypothetico-deductive method in a work consisting of twenty-one definitions, two axioms, and five observations of natural law, the Elementa. Many of this philosopher's theories were developed while he was serving as tutor to Charles Xof Sweden. Unlike his teacher's On the Laws of War and Peace, this thinker argued for a theory of just war based on the concept of a man's duty.

This work's adagio third movement concludes with a lyrical melody in B-flat major before transitioning into the more imposing B-flat minor opening of the finale without pause. This piece's adagio-moderato first movement opens with a recitative on the solo instrument followed immediately by a short cadenza. The six-bar main theme of this piece is then first carried by the violas in 9/8 time before it is echoed by the soloist. This piece was first recorded electronically with soloist Beatrice Harrison, though its most famous performance was conducted by John Barbirolli and recorded by a 20-year old female soloist. For 10 points, identify this piece popularized by Jacqueline du Pre, an E minor composition for orchestra and a string instrument written by the composer of the Enigma Variations.",

Information on the coupling between the centers studied in this technique and their environment can be studied using pulsed ENDOR. Peak splitting in this technique is caused by hyperfine coupling.

The Bain model describes how rapid cooling of this substance causes a diffusionless phase transition in which this substance converts from a face-centered cubic to a tetragonal crystal structure. The HSLA form of this substance does not contain the eutectoid pearlite, thus lacking the alternate layering of the alpha phase of its primary constituent and cementite. The aforementioned phase transition in this substance converts austenite to martensite. Adding 10.5% chromium to this alloy mixture allows it to resist corrosion.

This process causes a reduction in intensity over time of an FID signal. This process leads to magnetization transfer between two nuclei in the nuclear Overhauser effect.

After one participant in this battle received an arrow to the skull, the physician John Bradmore is said to have poured honey into the wound and invented a pair of tongs to extract the arrow. The Earl of Stafford was killed and his right wing fled the field, under attack from archers recruited from Cheshire, while the royal standard bearer Sir Walter Blount was mistaken for the king and killed. The losing commander here had turned on the king for not ransoming his brother-in-law Edmund Mortimer, and was supported by his uncle, the Earl of Winchester, but sadly did not receive any troops from Owen Glendower.

In the second movement of another concerto for this instrument, before the last two measures the accompaniment consists entirely of sixteenth notes in the first violin and eighth notes in the rest of the non-soloist parts. Another concerto for this instrument features an andante spiccato opening movement and a second movement adagio that was transcribed for harpsichord by J.S. Bach. In Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral arrangement of Polovetsian Dances, this instrument introduces the theme of the first dance. Concerti in D minor for this instrument were written by Alessandro Marcello and Tomaso Albinoni. A similar instrument lacks this instrument's low B flat key but otherwise has the same fingerings and is pitched a fifth lower; that instrument is the English horn. For 10 points, name this double reed woodwind instrument that plays the tuning note before orchestra performances.",

That rate constant arises from the Eigen-Wilkins mechanism, which describes this kind of reaction. In square planar complexes, the rate of this kind of reaction can be enhanced by the presence of a strong sigma donor ligand on the other side of the complex in the trans effect. This type of reaction can take place via associative or interchange mechanisms. Alcohols can be converted to tosylates to increase their reactivity in this kind of reaction. In a noted mechanism for this type of reaction, inversion of stereochemistry occurs as a nucleophile forces out a leaving group in a single step.

The maximum capacitance occurs when carbon electrode pore size equals the ion size in capacitors which rely on this structure. The charge density at these structures is proportional to the hyperbolic sine of e z times the potential times beta in the Grahame equation. The diffuse section of this structure usually begins at the outer Helmholtz plane. The lack of this structure at a protein's isoelectric point is the reason that proteins at that point coagulate so easily. These structures exist in equilibrium of attractive van der Waals forces and repulsive electric force in the DLVO theory of colloids and the potential at their slipping planes is the zeta potential.
