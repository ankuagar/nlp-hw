  "Gregory Bateson borrowed this thinker's division of the world into pleroma and creatura. His disciple Barbara Hannah wrote the book Encounters with the Soul about his development of the technique of active imagination. His interest in gnosticism led him to write a work which he attributed to Basilides, Seven Sermons to the Dead. According to this thinker, the crucial process in the development of the psyche is the integrative process of individuation. He described a male's feminine qualities and a female's masculine qualities as the anima and animus, respectively, which are two examples of the psychological archetypes he proposed.
