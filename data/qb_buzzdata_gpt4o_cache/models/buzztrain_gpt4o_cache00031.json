  "One account about a member of this dynasty recounts how King Judicael refused to dine with him because of his irreligiousness, electing instead to eat with Dado, the future St. Audoin. One of this dynasty's kings was shaved bald and sent to a monastery by the usurper Grimoald, who installed his son, inexplicably known as \"the Adopted,\" at the helm of this dynasty. The defeat of Berchar, the son-in-law of Waratto, and one of its kings at Tertry is often said to mark the de facto end of this dynasty, which rose to prominence following victories at Tolbiac, Soissons, and Vouillle over the Alemanni, the warlord Syagrius, and another warlord. Brunhilda variously ruled or advised the rulers of this dynasty, whose best contemporary sources are Fredegar and (*) Gregory of Tours. This dynasty was subjugated by the Arnulfings, and it endured a period of \"do-nothing kings\" or \"rois faineants\" following the reign of Dagobert. Theuderic II was unable to reincorporate Burgundy and Neustria together under the united control of this dynasty, which was originally founded by a son of Childeric.
