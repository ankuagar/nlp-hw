  "The Kelvin waves caused by this phenomenon are forced by mesoscale thermal stochastic sources that can be visualized as a meridonial distribution. The Ekman effect is a proposed nonlinear mechanism for this phenomenon, which may be positively reinforced by ENSO. Nakazawa showed that this phenomenon may consist of supercloud clusters and inertial gravity waves that propagate in opposite directions. This atmospheric phenomenon strongly affects jet streams in the winter, splitting them prior to \"pineapple-express\" events. The width of the approximately two-dimensional intertropical convergence zone varies with this phenomenon. The presence of this phenomenon is associated with an \"enhanced phase\" and a \"suppressed phase\" of thunderstorm activity, which is felt as a midsummer break in the Asian monsoon. For 10 points, name this doubly eponymous atmospheric phenomenon commonly called the 30-60 day oscillation.": {
