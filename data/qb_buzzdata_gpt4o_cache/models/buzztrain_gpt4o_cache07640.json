  "Two months before this engagement, the opposing commanders had met at the Battle of the Alte Veste, and the Vicomte de Turenne served as an attache to this battle's eventual victor, bringing his ideas on military improvement back to France. Early in this battle, Rudolf Colloredo allerted the rest of his army of the attacking forces. One side featured the cavalry commander Torsten Stalhandske, while this battle featured early skirmishing at the Rippach river. The defender's left side was commanded by Heinrich Holk until reinforcements arrived from nearby Halle led by Pappenheim, who was later killed. The victorious army was commanded by Berhard of Saxe-Weimar after its leader fell in battle.

  "Its two outermost satellites, Neso and Psamathe, have the largest orbital semimajor axes of any natural satellites in the solar system. The orbit of its third-largest moon has a ridiculous eccentricity, over .75, while the five distinct arcs of one of its rings are named Fraternite, Egalite 1 and 2, Liberte, and Courage. Its largest satellite is known for its \"cantaloupe terrain\", while it also features the Galle, Lassell, and Le Verrier rings. Its moon Galatea serves as a shepherd for its Adams ring. This planet experiences long lasting anti-cyclonic storms that are generally referred to as Great Dark Spots. Its largest moon has an unusually high albedo and exhibits cryovolcanism, and is called Triton. For 10 points, identify this planet located just inside the Kuiper Belt and named after the Roman god of the sea.": {
