  "The love theme of this opera, introduced by two solo celli in act II, scene 2, is sung to text originally introduced as a trio for countertenor, contralto, and trumpet. The title character first sings at the \"Window of Appearances,\" after which tubular bells reprise the coronation theme. In act III, scene 3 of this opera, the Scribe reprises the Prelude on lyrics from Frommer's travel guide, marking the shift from Year 17 to the present day. Just before that scene, Horemhab and Aye sing \"Let the king care for his land\" to convince the crowd to rise up and kill the title character and his family. The title character's \"Hymn,\" which is always sung in the native language of the audience, is paired with Psalm 104 to emphasize his monotheism. Written in ? Biblical Hebrew, Akkadian and Ancient Egyptian, FTP, name this \"portrait\" opera by Philip Glass named for a pharaoh. ": {
