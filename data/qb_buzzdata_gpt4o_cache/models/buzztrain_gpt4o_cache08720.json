  "This man wrote of a figure whose \"lucid essence flames with lightnings\" as he tells God that \"Of light drawn from the holy fount\" will \"all time and all space\" braid him a mystic crown and that \"pain is the only nobility.\" That figure, the Poet, appears in \"Benediction\" as well as a poem wherein he is compared to a \"prince of the clouds\" who pathetically lets his \"great white wings\" drag after sailors catch him. This man also created a character who \"dreams of scaffolds as he smokes his hookah pipe\"; that figure is Ennui, who is known to the hypocrite twin.
