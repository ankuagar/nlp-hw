The suspicious death of a possible  witness to this event in an al egedly accidental fal from a car led the Pospelov Commission to conclude  that this action may have been purposeful y ordered. This action was committed on December 1, 1934 by  Leonid Nikolayev, touching off a series of purges that would claim, among others, Zinoviev and Kamenev.
