  "The heroine of this opera sings, \"Dich, teure Halle,\" about the castle in which Act II is set, after which she agrees to be the prize in the Landgrave's competition. After an overture featuring the Pilgrims' Chorus, a ballet orgy featuring castanets occurs. Its title character escapes the grotto and meets a hunting party that includes a character who later sings a song to the evening star, Wolfram. Having admitted his dalliance at the Venusberg during the singing competition at Wartburg, the title character journeys to Rome to seek penance. However, he is not forgiven until a priest's staff sprouts leaves, after his own death and that of his love, Elizabeth. FTP, name this opera about a knight and minstrel by Richard Wagner.": {
