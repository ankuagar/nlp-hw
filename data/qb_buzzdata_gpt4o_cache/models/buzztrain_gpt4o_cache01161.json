  "Daniel Smith has been called the \"Rampal\" of this instrument for reviving works like Henry Hargrave's fourth concerto as well as the four concerti of Christian Graupner. Heitor Villa-Lobos composed his Ciranda de Sos Notas for it, while Sofia Gubaidulina's concerto for this instrument is usually recorded alongside her Duo Sonata for it, both of which were inspired by her friend Valery Popov. Prokofiev wrote a \"humoristic Scherzo\" for four of them, and other works for it include Gliere's Humoresque and Impromptu and Weber's (*) Andante e rondo ungarese.
