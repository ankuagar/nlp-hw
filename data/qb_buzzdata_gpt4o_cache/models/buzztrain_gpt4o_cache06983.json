  "The section discussing the distribution of alms is followed by a chapter on the temptations of the enemy and the importance of understanding \"scruples.\"  Another section of this work details the \"three types of men\" and the \"three kinds of humility.\"  It advocates a position that \"the intimate understanding and relish of truth\" derives from self discovery rather than being preached at.  This work was first printed as a Latin translation by Andre des Freux known as the versio vulgata, though the bulk of this 1548 work was written during a retreat at Manresa. Containing such sections as \"The Kingdom of Christ\" and \"The Two Standards,\" it is divided into \"weeks\" and outlines a regimen of meditation that its author deemed central to the establishment of the Society of Jesus.  For 10 points, identify this pedagogical work by St. Ignatius of Loyola.": {

  "One section of this organ contains Clara cells.

Release of vasoactive mediators in this organ results in ARDS, and this organ is also the site of silicosis, berylliosis, and ferruginous bodies resulting from asbestos exposure. Cancers of this organ are divided into small-cell and non-small-cell varieties, and in humans one half of this organ has three lobes while the other has two.

  "In this section of a larger work, one character introduces himself as Gagnard, and the title character of this work frequently uses the formulation \"since on the hall floor you want to try your luck.\" The last section of this work is in the galdralag meter though most of it, as befits a poem about wisdom, is in the ljodahattr meter. After demanding twelve answers from the title being, a character in this work introduces every one of his stanzas with the phrase, \"much have I traveled, much have I tried out, much have I tested the powers.\" This work features a similar trick to the one used to defeat King Heidrik in the Heidrikssaga, and among the predictions of the title character are that Lif and Lifthrasir will survive Fimbulvetr and that Vidar will kill Fenrir.

  "One section of this text examines the use of an \"index word\" to convey various scenarios, such as \"collid[ing] with the police car,\" \"warming myself before the fire,\" and \"ca[tching] myself beginning to dream.\" That section equates introspection with retrospection, describes \"higher-order actions\" criticizing \"lower-action\" ones, and concludes that \"No metaphysical Iron Curtain exists compelling us to be forever absolute strangers to one another.\" In line with that thought, its author earlier discusses \"disposition\" and \"occurrence\" words and later dismisses imagination as simply playing in a theater box. It opens with the claim that to confuse the discourse of bodies and the discourse of the title entities is to imagine the title entity as a \"ghost in the machine.\" For 10 points, identify this work of metaphysical philosophy by Gilbert Ryle.": {

Later in that same chapter its author discusses the concept of life in Count Yorck. In its third part, the author argues that humans are in the world through being in language.

  "The second of these pieces was actually written about ten years before the first, at the same time as a never-published piece in the same form that shares the key signature of the fifth of these, E-flat major. The fourth of these works was premiered along with a notable Choral Fantasia, but went unperformed from then until its 1836 revival by Mendessohn. The third of these works was premiered along with the oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives and its composer's Second Symphony. All of these works contain cadenzas written by the composer himself. The last two are dedicated to the composer's patron, Archduke Rudolph, a fact which, along with its great length, led to the fifth and last of these works being nicknamed the Emperor.
