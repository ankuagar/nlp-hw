A repeated motif describes the title character as \"enlightened by compassion\" and is sung by a voice from above at the end of Act I. This opera's Act I prelude quotes the (*) Dresden amen, and in Act III the title character baptizes the central female to the accompaniment of the Good Friday Music. Act II of this opera takes place in Klingsor's garden, where the Flower-maidens and Kundry all attempt to seduce the title character, who recoils because he feels compassion for Amfortas's wound. For 10 points, name this last opera of Richard Wagner, whose title \"pure fool\" is crowned king of the Knights of the Grail.": {
