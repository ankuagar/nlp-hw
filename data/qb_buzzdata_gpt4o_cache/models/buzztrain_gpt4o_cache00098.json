  "This agreement was negotiated by Luis Mendez de Haro and Hugues de Lionne, one of the architects of the League of the Rhine which prompted it. For its participation in the Reapers' War, one country was awarded Roussillon and Artois in this agreement, and that country also received parts of Flanders and Luxembourg. The English, led by William Lockhart, succeeded in gaining Dunkirk in this agreement, a city which they had captured at the Battle of the Dunes in which Louis II de Bourbon, the Prince of Conde was defeated by the Vicomte de Turenne. In this agreement, the infanta Maria Theresa, daughter of King Philip IV, renounced her claim to the throne in exchange for marrying Louis XIV, but the failure to pay the dowry led to the War of Devolution. Cardinal Mazarin negotiated this treaty, which ended a war between two countries that the Peace of Westphalia had failed to end.

  "Agracha and Bu Craa are some of the exciting mine centers of this place, which borders Cape Bojador and includes the city of Smara. The indigenous population of this area is composed mainly of ethnic Sahrawis, although many have been displaced and they may now be outnumbered by government-sponsored settlers. It is among the least-densely populated regions in the world, and over half its population lives in the largest city, El Aaiun. It is comprised of the former Spanish colonies of Saguia al-Hamra and Rio de Oro, and the Polisario Front seeks its independence.
