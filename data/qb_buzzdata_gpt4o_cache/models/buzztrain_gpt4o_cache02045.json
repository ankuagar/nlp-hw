  "This figure can be seen walking through a path betweeen a mountain and a high throne outside of an impossibly fantastic castle in a masterpiece of Gustave Moreau. Renaissance artists who frequently depicted this man included sodomist Il Sodoma, who painted a series on the life of this ruler. He can be seen holding his arms out wide as he receives the title conquered figure's family in a painting of Veronese. One of this man's equestrian victories can be found in a fresco within the House of the Fawn. A different work of art with the same title shows this man's troops below a moon on the top left and a rising sun just above some mountains in the middle right. A source by Aventinus calling this man the sun god can be found in that painting, which depicts a scroll over his massive army.
