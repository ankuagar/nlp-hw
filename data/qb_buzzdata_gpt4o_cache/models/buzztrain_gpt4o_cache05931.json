  "This play begins with a Stage-Keeper apologizing to the audience for the delayed start, saying that there's a problem with one of the players' black silk stockings. The Stage-Keeper then criticizes the play for lacking elements like jugglers and trained apes, but he's shooed off stage by the Book-Keeper. The servant Humphrey Waspe comes to town in search of a marriage license, and gets into a fight with Knockem, resulting in a trip to the stocks, but the lawyer Trouble-All shows up and demands a warrant. It's revealed that Littlewit's stage puppets have no genitalia, and therefore cannot be guilty of crossdressing. The characters then pair off with Dame Purecraft being won by Quarlous at the house of Justice Adam Overdo. Also known for featuring the Puritan Zeal-of-the-Land Busy, FTP, name this Jacobean play about misadventures at a summer festival in London, a work by Ben Jonson.": {

In one of his plays, Protasov works diligently to perfect mankind, oblivious to his best friend's attempts to woo his wife. This author of Enemies and Children of the Sun wrote a play in which Natasha's sister burns her legs by throwing boiling oil on them, and her lover Pepel kills Kostilioff. In that play, his most famous, the idealistic Luka tries to uplift such characters as the thief Vaska and a drunken former actor. That play is about a lodging house inhabited by the dregs of society.

  "When placed in an alternating environment, materials exhibiting this phenomenon lose energy according to Steinmetz's law.  Two important parameters characterizing materials that display this behavior are the coercivity and the remanence.  Bloch showed that the exchange energy associated with this phenomenon results in walls of finite thickness between Weiss domains.  Its response lags behind a cycling applied field, a phenomenon known as hysteresis.
