  "Undoubtedly the most famous Canadian example of this genre is about atomic bomb testing in Polynesia; that work is Laurence Hyde's Southern Cross. One work in this genre is about a slave trader who kills an African and steals his drum, and is called Madman's Drum. Another work in this genre follows a generic man's trip through a city, after which he enters a forest and dies, whereupon his soul leaves his body and stomps on his heart. The pioneers of this genre included Otto (*) N\u00fcckel and the author of The Idea and Passionate Journey, Frans Masereel. This genre was introduced to America by the author of such works as Wild Pilgrimage and Gods' Man, Lynd Ward. For 10 points, name this genre of proto-graphic novels with no text, which was popular among the German Expressionists.": {
