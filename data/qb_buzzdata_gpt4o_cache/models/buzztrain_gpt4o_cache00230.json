  "One approach to synthesizing this compound was described by Hegedus and Semmelhack. The reaction for one type of these with alkynes to yield alkoxyphenols was discovered by Karl D\u00f6tz and is better known as a benzannulation reaction. One classical way of making these is done by conducting a nucleophilic addition of an organolithium compound to a metal carbonyl and then treating with a trialkyloxonium salt. This compound can be found in Grubb's catalyst and those with high oxidation states and an unpaired triplet state are named for Schrock, which contrast with those named for Fischer. For 10 points, name these organic compounds with a divalent carbon atom that has only six valence electrons.": {
