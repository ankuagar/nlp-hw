He also painted an overdeck truss bridge in one painting of a picaresque village with a peaceful brook running through it.  In addition to Fall Plowing and Stone City, he painted a horse and rider galloping past a tall white church in a darker painting of a similar town, his Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.  This artist reproduced Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware in the background of one more well known painting of three ugly women, one of whom holds a porcelain teacup.
