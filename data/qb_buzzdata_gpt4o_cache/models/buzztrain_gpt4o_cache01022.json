  "The creator of this file format hired the exotic dancer Chastity Fischer to be his chauffeur and companion.  That inventor of this format was so bad at cleaning that the Police got a warrant to search his house because  of complaints about the smell and he later died from chronic alcoholism while cradling a bottle of peppermint  schnapps. This format includes an extended local header and recent versions of its specification have added  support for PPMd. The initial version of this file format was developed by Phil Katz. The central location and  protagonist within the central entity of this question is the central directory. The specification for this format  is maintained by PKWARE. This file format often contains data that has been processed by the DEFLATE  algorithm. JAR files are actual a variant of this format. On Unix systems, input data is often run through tar before  being sent to a program that outputs of this file format in part because each file is archived separately in this format.  Programs for handling these files include 7 this and Win this. For 10 points, name this common format for  compressing files.": {
