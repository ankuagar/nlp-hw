  "In her desperate times the heroine of this novel is taken in by Bob Jakin and is only offered sympathy by her cousin and her Aunt Glegg.  Following the second stroke of the heroine's father, who was forced to work for his enemy, Wakem, a two-year period passes in St. Ogg's before this novel brings Stephen Guest and Lucy Deane onto center stage.  The action climaxes with a massive flood that eventually results in the drowning deaths of Tom and Maggie Tulliver in the titular river.  FTP, name this novel by George Eliot.": {

  "Despite her liberal leanings, Mrs. Busk is forced to fire Petra after receiving three anonymous letters. When Morten and Ejlif are sent home for fighting, their father resolves to open his own school and educate them himself, thus producing \"high-minded men\" capable of driving out the \"wolves.\" The main character proclaims \"the (*) majority never has right on its side\" in front of a gathering of townspeople at Captain Horster's house, leading them to call him by the title epithet as the publisher of \"The People's Herald\" turns against him. The main character's father-in-law offers him a deal if he will retract his statements that Morten Kiil's tannery is polluting the baths that the townspeople believe will bring them prosperity. Dr. Stockmann is, for 10 points, the titutlar character of what play by Henrik Ibsen?": {
