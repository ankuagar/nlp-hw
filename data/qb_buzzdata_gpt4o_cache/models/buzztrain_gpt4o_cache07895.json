  "Unusually for human cells, around 50% of them are polyploid and multinucleate. These cells are arranged into sheets supported by reticulin networks, and surround vascular areas called sinusoids. They are responsible for synthesizing serum albumin, fibrinogen and thrombin, and they also synthesize apoproteins in order to export LDL and HDL. Separated form endothelial cells by the Space of Disse, these cells are also the main site of gluconeogenesis. These cells express carbamoyl phosphate synthase and arginase I as part of the urea cycle.
