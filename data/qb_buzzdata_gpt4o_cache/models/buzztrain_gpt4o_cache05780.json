  "Paul Boghossian argued that this position is incompatible with privileged self-knowledge, and Tyler Burge defended a version of this thesis by describing a woman named Jane whose community uses \"arthritis\" to refer to disease of both joints and thighs. Andy Clark and David Chalmers propose an \"active\" version of it in their work on extended cognition. Proponents of this position argue there is no such thing as narrow content. The causal theory of reference is used to support this position in a thought experiment invoking a substance with the same macroscopic properties as water, but the formula XYZ. That \"Twin Earth\" scenario was introduced in \"The Meaning of Meaning\" by Hilary Putnam, who also used this position to refute the brain-in-a-vat thought experiment.
