  "This technique is employed by the algorithm used to account for rain stoppages in one-game cricket matches and by an algorithm that finds the most likely trajectory of hidden states to result in a given sequence of observations named for Viterbi. A major result in this technique was employed in Robert C. Merton's paper on the intertemporal capital asset pricing model and is, in a continuous-time formulation, also named for Hamilton and Jacobi. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm employs this process for sequence alignment in bioinformatics; one implementation of that algorithm uses only big oh of n plus m space by using an optimization common in this technique first used in Hirschberg's algorithm. An equation governing this technique gives the value function of a state x as the max over all actions a available in x of F of x and a plus the discount factor times the value function of the state to which a takes x. This technique is employed to solve the knapsack problem and in a shortest-path algorithm partly named for Ford. The Bellman equation governs, for 10 points, what essential technique in computer science, in which one decomposes a problem into manageable, usually overlapping subproblems, which can often involve recursion?": {

In another, an armless woman sitting on a checkerboard carpet and wearing only a garment resting at the bottom of her back, a dangly earring, and fabric headgear has her bare back compared with a violin's with two f-holes drawn onto it. Besides Noire et Blanche and Violon d'Ingres, which feature Kiki de Montparnasse, he took a series of photographs, including one featuring a nude holding a large wheel and displaying a black-stained arm, Erotique Voil\u00e9e, of M\u00e9ret Oppenheim, and others feature Rrose S\u00e9lavy, the feminine alter ego of a frequent collaborator. He is best known for a technique, examples of which led to negatives using things like a spiral of paper, and a gun and a key, which showed only their form.
