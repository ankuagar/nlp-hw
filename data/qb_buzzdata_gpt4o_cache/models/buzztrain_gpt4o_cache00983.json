Along with an alcohol, a product of this reaction can be used with diethyl azodicarboxylate in the Mitsnobu reaction, and that product is also a side product in synthesizing amines in the Staudinger reaction. A modification of this reaction uses phenyllithium and hydrochloric acid at low temperatures, to get the reaction mechanism, converting the erythro betaine intermediate to a threo betaine. That modification will yield the E- isomer as opposed to the Z- isomer normally yielded by this reaction, and that modification is named for Schlosser.

Its third movement consists of a scherzo with a tempo direction that asks for \"quietly flowing motion,\" and returns this symphony to its key of three flats.  In the fourth movement, an alto singer is introduced to imitate the singing of a child for the spiritual song, \"Urlicht,\" which along with \"St. Anthony of Padua's Sermon to the Fishes\" comprises the selection of Wunderhorn songs adapted for this symphony, whose completion was inspired by the funeral of Hans von Bulow.

  "The commission for this structure is unusual in that it was issued to the architect outright by Emile Biasini, honoring the architect's demand not to have to compete for a bid. Taking advantage of the decision to remove the Ministry of Finance offices from one of the main building's wings, the architect requested the construction of an underground courtyard entrance to re-center the existing building around the Cour Napoleon. A set of seven triangular fountains form a surrounding \"C\" shape around this 70 foot structure, which covers that new entrance and lets in light for its reception center.

The second of two of  these works comprising their composer's Opus 40 was described by Anton Rubinstein as a nation's tragedy. One of them  opens with a descending \"A-E-E-E\" followed by scale-wise ascent to a C-sharp, representing the same nation's glory. The  final seven of these works, published during their composer's (*) exile in Paris, include Op. 53 in A-flat major, whose middle  passage's continuous left hand octaves represent galloping horsemen. All of them follow a rhythm with an eighth note, two  sixteenth notes, and four eighth notes in 3/4 time. For 10 points, name these pieces, which include the \"Military\" and \"Heroic.\"": {

  "This composer's first time basing an entire movement on a tone row was in the \"Surge, aquilo\" section of a late sacred work dedicated to the city of Venice. During the last two decades of his life, this composer frequently collaborated with the conductor Robert Craft. Tuberculosis prevented this composer of Canticum Sacrum from conducting the premiere of a concerto grosso in E-flat he wrote for the wedding of Robert Woods Bliss. One work by this composer is the namesake of a dissonant chord consisting of two major triads a tritone apart. That ballet by him is about a love triangle between the title character, the Ballerina, and the Moor, all of whom are puppets.
