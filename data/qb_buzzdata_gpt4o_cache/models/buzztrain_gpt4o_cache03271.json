  "The infantile form of this disease, which can be caused by a mutation in the GM2 activator protein, is most often caused by a four-base-pair insertion, while a rare adult-onset form can result from being a heterozygote with two mutant alleles. It is normally caused by mutations of the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which leads to low serum levels of hexos-aminidase A. It can be diagnosed by a characteristic \"cherry-red\" spot on the retina due to the inability to hydrolyze certain compounds consisting of sialic acid and glyco- sphingolipids, known as gangliosides, which then build up in the lysosomes.
