  "Potentials named for their special treatment of this quantity include one named for Jerry Tersoff, and one model named for this quantity suggests that the two outermost layers of a nanoparticle experience the bulk of melting point depression. Stuart's extension of Brenner's potential was intended to better treat this concept. The Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model explains certain phenomena that occur in molecules like Zeise's salt that tend to decrease this quantity. This quantity is limited for late transition metals with oxygen in a phenomenon known as the oxo wall. Pairs of atoms for which this quantity exceeds unity are unlikely to include a bridgehead according to Bredt's rule. This quantity is three-halves for both carbon-oxygen bonds in a carboxylate ion, and rotation is inhibited whenever it's greater than one. For 10 points, name this quantity, which is formally calculated by half the number of bonding minus antibonding electrions, which is equal to two between the carbons in an alkene.": {
