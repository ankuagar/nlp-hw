Their activities can form cryptodomes, which, when moved from their original location, are known as coulees. Their actions are sometimes described as phreatic or (*) plinian depending on whether they create large amounts of steam. They can create flows of pahoehoe or aa, and they come in composite, shield, and cinder cone varieties.
