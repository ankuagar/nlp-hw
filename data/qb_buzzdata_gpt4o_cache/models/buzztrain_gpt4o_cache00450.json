  "This belief was refuted by a 1945 American military pamphlet, which tried to challenge 112 \"gripes\" in this vein held by soldiers. A Newt Gingrich ad against Mitt Romney played on this feeling by showing a clip of Romney at the Winter Olympics doing the same thing as John Kerry. Jonah Goldberg popularized a Ken Keeler phrase associated with this feeling in a National Review article giving 10 reasons why it was a valid belief. This feeling intensified after a 2003 speech at the UN in which a Foreign Minister said his country knew \"wars, occupation, and barbarity\" and thus rejected the Iraqi war, which brought much lampooned changes to the Congressional cafeteria's menu. For 10 points, name this sentiment commonly seen in the United States, as represented by the phrase \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" and by the changing of a food's name to \"freedom fries.\"": {
