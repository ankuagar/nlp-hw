  "One of this man's daughters was trampled to death by horses on the orders of her jealous husband Ermanaric. An old man helped this figure select a horse at the river Busiltj\u00f6rn. One myth describes him as a prince of Xanten whose only weakness is a spot on his back where a linden leaf had landed. He killed one foe after hiding in a trench dug to catch that figure's blood, a taste of which caused him to learn the language of the birds. This grandson of Eylimi and son of Hjordis was eventually killed by Guttorm. He owned Grani and inherited sword fragments from his father, which were reforged by his foster father Regin. This man married Gudrun after a magical ale allowed him to forget Brynhild, but may be most famous for using his father's sword Gram to kill the dragon Fafnir.
