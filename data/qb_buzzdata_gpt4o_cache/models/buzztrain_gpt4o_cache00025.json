  "The absolute value of any cofactor of a graph's Laplacian matrix is equal to the number of a certain type of this object. That theorem is a generalization of Cayley's theorem, which says there are n to the n minus two of these objects on n vertices. An algorithm that uses the union-find data structure to merge these objects in increasing order of edge weights is known as Kruskal's algorithm and, like Prim's Algorithm, finds the (*) minimum weight one of these that spans a set of vertices.
