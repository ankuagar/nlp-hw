  "A notable study of this school was written in 1937 by Donald Dudley. Metrocles was a lesser known member of this school, while another member of this school had an argument with Theodorus the Atheist, whom she rebutted by asking whether it was wrong to ''spend her time on education rather than wasting it on the loom.\" This school which emphasized anaideia and autarkeia had a member from Maroneia named Hipparchia, and she was married to Crates of Thebes, another member.  Perhaps the most famous member carried a lantern during the day looking for an honest man, and adherents to this school ridiculed social conventions.
