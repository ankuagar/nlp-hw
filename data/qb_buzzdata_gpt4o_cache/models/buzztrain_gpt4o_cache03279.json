  "Inspirations for the program of this work, whose most familiar version was produced by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov after the composer's death, included Pushkin's Tzar Saltan and the composer's opera Undine, whose music was recycled for its famous love duet. The central female is kidnapped by the evil sorcerer Rothbart, who tricks the prince into pledging his fidelity to Odile, and her parents' tears form the titular location. In most versions, Odette then dies or is condemned to remain away from Siegfried in the form of the titular bird. For 10 points, name this ballet, the first by Tchaikovsky.": {
