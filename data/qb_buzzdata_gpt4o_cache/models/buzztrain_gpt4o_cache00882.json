  "With Christian Otto Mohr, this scientist names a model that measures the effect of stress on brittle materials. This man invented the torsion balance and names a law of friction that states that an object's sliding velocity does not affect its kinetic friction. This scientist used the torsion balance to measure the electrostatic force between charges, and he names an inverse- square law which can be used to determine the force between two charged particles. For 10 points, name this French namesake of the SI unit of charge.": {
