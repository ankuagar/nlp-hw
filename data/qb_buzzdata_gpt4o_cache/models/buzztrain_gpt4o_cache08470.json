  "During this war, a loss by General Stackelberg preceded a hasty retreat by General Keller at Motien Pass. It started with a surprise attack made while Admiral Stark was throwing his wife a birthday party; Stark was blamed for the mixed results at that battle. Mikasa was the flagship in the first battle using wireless telegraphy, during which Oskar Enkvist fled to Manila and Nikolai Nebogatov was taken prisoner. Its last land battle, at Mukden, was a decisive loss for General Kuropatkin, and other major fighting in this war took place at Tsushima and Port Arthur.  Name this war ended by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905, whose negotiation led to a Nobel Peace Prize for Teddy Roosevelt.": {
