  "After this battle, an Ohio newspaper inaccurately claimed the winning force had lost, while other newspapers spent more time mourning the death of noted Kentucky lawyer Joseph Daveiss than the outcome. A month after this battle, the losing side was encouraged by the New Madrid Earthquake, interpreted as a good omen by one of their leaders. The losing commander blamed the loss on his menstruating wife interfering with his (*) magical powers. This battle was a victory for the \"Yellow Jacket\" force. The two commanders would later fight again in a battle in Upper Canada, which saw Richard Johnson kill the losing commander's brother. This battle took place at Prophetstown, the home of the Shawnee mystic Tenskwatawa. For 10 points, name this 1811 loss for Tecumseh's forces which gave William Henry Harrison his nickname.": {
