  "The photographer and art critic Nadar called one of these things \"flatulent\" in an 1832 portrait of French writer and art collector; in that painting, Ingres's Portrait of Monsieur Bertin, two of these things are the only light parts of the lower half, and are fat and spread out. One of these things, \"in the form of a toad, provokes hilarity,\" according to Ernest Chesneau's review of Edouard Manet's Olympia. A drawing of two of these things was first exhibited in 1871, and was originally made around 1508 by a (*) German engraver as a study for an apostle in the Heller Altarpiece. Douglas Hofstadter called a 1948 lithograph showing two of these things an example of a \"strange loop\"; that M.C. Escher work shows two of these things \"drawing\" each other into existence. For 10 points, an Albrecht Durer drawing shows two of what body parts \"praying\"?": {
