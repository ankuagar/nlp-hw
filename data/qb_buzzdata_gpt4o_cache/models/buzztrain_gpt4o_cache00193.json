  "In ancient times, this holiday was commemorated by a procession to the Pool of Siloam to fetch three logs of water, while at the time another procession would go to a place in the Kidron Valley called Motza. In first Judges, it is described celebrated in Shiloh with dances by maidens in vineyards. Chronologically the first of the Shloshet ha Regalim, Shemini Atzeret, falls immediately after the close of this holiday, which is thought to be the time during which God allots the yearly supply of rainwater. On each of the seven days of this holiday, which falls in the month of Tishri, observers wave the Four Species, consisting of the lulav and the etrog. Bamboo and pine are common components of the s'chach, or roofs, of the namesake structures associated with this festival.
