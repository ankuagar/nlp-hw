  "The protagonist of this work is financially backed by Tim Daland, and engages in a love affair with Dr. Claire Lewicki.  A back story involves the mysterious death of Buddy Bretherton, which may have been caused by Harry Hogge's incompetence.  The climactic scene occurs when the protagonist defeats Russ Wheeler, redeeming himself and Rowdy Burns, who will regain his sponsorship as a result.  Thus ends this 1990 work about the adventures of Cole Trickle.  FTP, identify this film often criticized as \"Top Gun on wheels,\" a movie in the world of Nascar starring Tom Cruise.": {

Starting in telophase, it completes the division of cells.  FTP, name this division of the cytoplasm.": {

The situation comes to a head when Hennebeau refuses to bargain on the conditions in Montsou, and it is pretty much only the protagonist, Etienne Lantier, who survives to continue his Marxist preaching.
