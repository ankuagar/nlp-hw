  "In the background of one work in this series of paintings, a rainbow arches over a flaming bolt striking Chigi Palace to commemorate a miracle where Sigismondo de Conti's house was not damaged when hit by lightning. In the background of another one of these paintings a horse wades in a cold lake surrounded by snowy mountains and bare trees, while the central figure originally held a pomegranate rather than a book. In addition to that painting commissioned by the Connestabile family for the Russian tsarina, another one of these paintings shows an Archangel presenting Tobias who holds a shining fish whose gall bladder he used to cure his father's blindness. Along with the \"Foligno\" and \"Tempi\" versions of this type of painting, the artist's pupil Gianfrancesco Penni helped complete one showing the main figure \"with a blue diadem,\" while another one is sometimes named after the Englishman Lord Garvagh but is usually titled after the Aldobrandini family. The influence of the artist's teacher Perugino is seen on the small Cowper one, while in one the most famous ones an infant strokes a goldfinch held by John the Baptist.
