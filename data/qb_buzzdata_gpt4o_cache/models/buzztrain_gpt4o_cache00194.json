  "In an anecdote illustrating this quality, the painter Apelles throws a sponge in frustration at his effort to paint the foam on a horse's mouth, only then succeeding in doing so. In The Will to Power, Friedrich Nietzsche denied that this quality equates with psychic health, because the desire for it is emblematic of nihilism and symptomatic of decadence. Michel de Montaigne's \"Apology for Raymond Sebond\" discusses how Zeno's conception of the division of the faculties of the soul as analogous to positions of his hand leads to belief in this \"straight and inflexible\" quality. Diogenes Laertius's story of a pig that ate calmly on a ship during a storm led Pyrrho to state that this quality was an ideal state of being in which people live in accordance with their nature. Sextus Empiricus said that it could be brought about by epoche, or suspension of judgment, and the Stoics associated it with apatheia. For 10 points, name this state of robust tranquility that Epicurus thought was the ideal condition for humans.": {
