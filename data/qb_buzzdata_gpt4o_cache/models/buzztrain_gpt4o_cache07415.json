  "The third of them discusses the Symbolic Snake, which made its first appearance in 429 BC.  The last of them discusses the qualities of an ideal ruler, who must not be at the mercy of his passions.  This work derives from a book published under the pseudonym of John Retcliffe, which itself derived from a book about Montesquieu and Machiavelli by Maurice Joly.  The former book, Biarritz, was written by a postal clerk and spy named Hermann Goedsche, who plagiarized extensively from Dumas's Joseph Balsamo.  A popular early edition of it was published by George Butmi, while Professor Sergei Nilus called attention to it under the name \"Chapter 18\" and claimed that it had been written in Basel.  Lucien Wolf exposed it in 1921, a year after a huge printing of it was sponsored by Henry Ford.

  "This thinker postulated that a sense of identity through time is shared by objects that comprise an \"intentional horizon,\" allowing one to expect a part of a familiar object that one hasn't seen yet. Individual hues exhibit his criteria of necessary dependence, lacked by things that merely stand side by side, found in his \"On the Theory of Wholes and Parts.\" In this philosopher's two-hour lectures given at the University of Sorbonne, he described how to take an example and find out the simplest part of it that can't be eliminated. Another of his techniques puts aside all scientific observations of an experience to focus on the experience itself. He came up with the \"eidetic reduction\" in Cartesian Meditations and the concepts of bracketing and epoche in his most famous work.
