  "Adherents of this religion believe that the firmament was created from the skin of the seven archontes after they were flayed by the Spirit of Life. Books sacred to this belief include one which tells the story of Ogias fighting a dragon, the Book of Giants, as well as the Kephalia, Treasure of Life, and Arzhang, which made its author doubly famous as an illustrator. Its founder was allowed to spread his teachings by Shapur I, to whom he dedicated the Shabuhragan, and his followers were divided into the elect and the hearers. That founder contended that the soul was corrupted by its association with evil matter, which necessitated the release of light matter.
