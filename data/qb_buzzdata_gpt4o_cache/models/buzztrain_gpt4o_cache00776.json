  "The 1983 Canadian Opera Company performance of this opera was the first time supertitles were used. One of its characters describes nightmares in which she is being chased by an avenging spirit in the aria \"Ich habe keine guten N\u00e4chte\" or \"I have no good nights.\" This opera opens with the \"fifth maid\" being punished for protesting the gossip of her coworkers. Its protagonist, who searches for a buried axe, is often accompanied with a namesake dissonant bitonal chord that combines E major and D major. That protagonist shares a recognition scene with her (*) brother and duets with her sister Chrysothemis before frenziedly dancing to death. For 10 points, name this first collaboration between Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss, an opera about a woman who avenges her father Agamemnon.": {
