  "The primary female character in this film is first seen sitting nude in a slowly revolving tub of water examining herself in a mirror as a carnival attraction that voyeurs can pay to watch. One character in this movie becomes flustered when the street peddler Jericho reads in her palm that she will marry the man she loves, while another character is kicked out of the club \"The Red Breast\" for defending the honor of one woman but refuses to sleep with her in her apartment at the Great Post House. In this film's second section called \"The Man in White,\" Count Edouard wrongly accuses the actor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick LeMa\u00eetre of sleeping with his wife after a performance of Othello before the Count is assassinated in a Turkish bath by the villainous Lacenaire. This film is critically studied for its comparison between the Grand Theater and the Funambules pantomime theatre, and it begins on the Boulevard du Temple when the mime Baptiste first meets the courtesan Garance. For 10 points, name this 1945 film shot in Paris during the Nazi occupation that was directed by Marcel Carne and is generally critically considered to be the greatest French film ever made.": {

One participant in this event had been selected specifically due to a prophecy that any child born to another participant in this event would become more powerful than his father. Taking place near Chiron's cave at Mount Pelion, this event saw the gifting of a golden suit of armor, a spear, and two horses named Xanthus and Balius to one participant, who was the brother of Telamon. This event was also the site of the place where Eris, having not been invited to it, dropped an apple engraved with the phrase \"To the fairest,\" thereby precipitating the conflict which would see the eventual death of the offspring born as a result of this event.
