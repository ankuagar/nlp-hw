  "One of this man's portraits depicts a man grasping the giant golden key to the Rock of Gibraltar, while another shows a portly hero of the Battle of Ushant leaning on his saber. He painted over a deteriorating version of his Strawberry Girl to create a portrait of a child called The Age of Innocence. This man's lecture series \"The Discourses of Art\" popularized the term \"grand style\". Portraits of Lords (*) Heathfield and Keppel were created by this man, who included a pile of dead birds and deer behind two aristocratic hunters in Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney: The Archers. An angry man holding a cup and a female figure carrying a dagger appear in shadows behind a seated actress in his most famous painting. For 10 points, name this British painter of Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse, the founder": {
