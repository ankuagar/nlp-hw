  "The double basses sustain an A-flat in this opera's lengthy second-act monologue. This opera's opening act features the tenor singing his father's name \"Walse\" and includes the love duet \"Wintersturme.\" One character in this opera introduces himself as \"woeful,\" or Wehwalt, instead of revealing his true name, and later has his weapon shattered by a spear strike. This opera ends with the Magic Fire Music, representing the circle of flame that Loge has lit to protect the title character. The prelude to its third act incorporates the battle cry \"Hojotoho\" and has its galloping main theme played by the brass. For 10 points, name this second opera of the Ring Cycle, in which the sisters of the title character, Brunnhilde, go on a famous \"ride.\"": {
