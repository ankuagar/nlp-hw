  "One holder of this position was married to Anna Pavlovna, sister of Alexander I, while a female holder of this position was married to Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and was known for issuing a famous \"flaming protest.\" A holder of this position attempted to forestall a revolution in his country in 1848 by allowing Johan Thorbecke to draft a new constitution, while the successor to that holder of this position caused Thorbecke's resignation by standing in opposition to the re-establishmet of a Catholic archbishopric in his country. Another holder of this position was the target of an independence movement in 1830, which achieved its goal when that holder of this position recognized an independent Belgium in 1839 and abdicated the following year. The last man to hold this position in the 19th century passed it to his daughter, Wilhelmina.

For ten points name this Jewish holiday that celebrates the giving of the Torah to Moses, which falls on the same day as Pentecost and is known as the Feast of Weeks.": {
