  "The gift of an elephant prompted Leo X to issue Praecelsae devotionis, which partially abrogated it in favor of an earlier papal declaration, Nicholas V's Romanus pontifex. An abortive conference was held on a bridge between the cities of Elvas and Badajoz to amend this document, which was based, in part on the earlier papal bull Inter Caetera. This document was extended by the Treaty of Zaragoza, which was prompted by the need to establish an eastern equivalent to this agreement. A distance of three-hundred seventy leagues west of Fogo, one of the Cape Verde Islands was established for a line of demarcation between the competing claims of two colonial powers.
