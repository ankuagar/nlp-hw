  "An important seven-point model in this subject was introduced by Wendell Bird, and one branch of it studies thrust faults. One of the first books on this subject was written by Philip Gosse, while the defining text on this subject was written by John Whitcomb and Henry (*) Morris. A man with Asperger's Syndrome by Proxy gate-crashed the opening of a museum devoted to this subject. Testimony by Marianne Wilson helped a federal district court rule that it was not science; that ruling was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Edwards v.
