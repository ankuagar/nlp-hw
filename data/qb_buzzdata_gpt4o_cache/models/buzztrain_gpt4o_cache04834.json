  "One movement of this piece uses a B major capriccioso to represent children quarrelling in the Tuileries. This piece's second movement uses four measures played \"velocissimo\" and \"con tutta forza\" to recreate the cry of the deformed \"Gnome.\" Maurice Ravel orchestrated this work, one movement of which describes \"The [*] Hut on Fowl's Legs\" that belongs to the witch Baba-Yaga. This piece uses \"promenades\" to represent walking between paintings like The Great Gate of Kiev.

  "This movement spread among southern slaves thanks to the work of Samuel Davies. Leaders of this movement included Theodorus Frelinghuysen, who inspired the founders of Log College, William and Gilbert Tennent. One opponent of this movement was Charles Chauncy, and it saw the first use of the terms \"Old Lights\" and \"New Lights.\" One speech given in support of this period spoke of \"great waters that are dammed for the present\" and an \"arrow made ready on the string,\" and opens with the quote \"Their foot shall slide in due time.\" One figure associated with this movement led a congregation at Northampton, while another was George Whitefield. The aforementioned speech, which uses the analogy of holding a spider over a fire, is Jonathan Edwards's \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\" For 10 points, name this first big religious revival in America, which began in the 1730s.": {
