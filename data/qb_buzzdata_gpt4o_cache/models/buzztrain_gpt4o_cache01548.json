  "The earliest polity thought to have based its power on these people's military and economic prowess is the Rus Khaganate, which emerged in the ninth century either at present-day Kiev or, more likely according to recent archaeological findings, along the Volkhov upstream of Lake Ladoga. One theory of Russian religious history points to these people as the means by which the self-sacrificing priest-king entered the Russian pagan pantheon shortly before the spread of Christianity, a transplant from the Norse Odin. Basil II's alliance with the Rus led to his forming an elite unit comprised of these people, and the Greece Runestones, found in numerous locations in Sweden, memorialize those who died as Byzantine mercenaries. For ten points, give the name for these Scandinavian traders and warriors who were powerful in medieval Russia and whose namesake guard fell to Alp Arslan's Turks at the Battle of Manzikert.": {

  "After earlier calling for his party to \"turn its face to the countryside\", this leader later contended \"the kulak in the countryside is more dangerous ... than the nepman in the town\".  This man uncharacteristically opposed the April Theses, although he had earlier served as the co-editor of the journal Sotsial-Demokrat with his mentor.  This leader of the \"New\" Opposition of 1925 joined forces with the Left Opposition and another man to form the United Opposition.  His role as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Comintern led him to be attributed to a document allegedly composed by the husband of Mrs. Bellgrade. Sentenced to death in a Show Trial involving the murder of Sergie Kirov, this long-time partner of Lev Kamenev attempted to oppose the rise of both Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin.  For 10 points, name this Bolshevik leader, a one-time \"right-hand man of ? Lenin\" who was accused of authoring a namesake letter calling for a proletariat revolt in England that was blamed for losing Ramsay MacDonald the 1924 Parliamentary Elections.": {
