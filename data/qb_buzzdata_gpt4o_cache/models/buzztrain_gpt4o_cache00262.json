  "This artist depicted a clerk, a farmer, and a soldier sleeping under a table-tree in The Land of Cockaigne. In another painting, a small crowd dances to the left of a cross while a magpie watches on the gallows. A skeleton army massacres humans in his Triumph of [*] Death. In one work in his series Labors of the Months, three figures return with dogs while skaters play on a frozen pond; the title figure makes a small splash in his Landscape with the Fall of Icarus. For 10 points, name this Dutch Renaissance painter, known for paintings such as The Peasant Wedding and The Hunters in the Snow.": {

  "This artist opened a school in Grunewald whose six star pupils included Lisa Milker, Anna Denzler, and Irma Erich-Grimme, who later adapted her last name. The Delsarte technique inspired this artist to crusade against restrictive corsets and toe shoes, which she believed unnaturally restricted the force of gravity. She thought that the soul existed in the solar plexus, which she considered the source of bodily movements. Her admiration for ancient Greek culture led her to break from the artificiality of classical ballet and dance in a loose, natural style in free-flowing costumes and bare feet. For 10 points, name this American dancer, a leading pioneer of modern dance, who died of a broken neck in 1927 when her long, flowing scarf became caught in the wheel of a car.": {

  "One of this artist's works is said to be the inspiration for the Kaufmann Head in the Louvre. One of this artist's most famous works was initially commissioned as a nude by the people of Kos, but was rejected for a draped version; the nude version became more successful. Another of his works depicts the title figure dangling grapes in front of an infant, whereas another of his sculptures depicts a figure from myth as he's about to (*) kill a lizard.

A folded newspaper reading \"jour\" and a tree with an eye in it appear to the right of the wavy lines that represent the title object of one of his paintings, while the title character of another is depicted as a guitar with an elongated neck and a diamond-patterned shirt.
