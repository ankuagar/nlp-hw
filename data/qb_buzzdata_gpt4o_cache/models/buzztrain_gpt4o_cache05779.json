  "The passage of this act in the Senate ensured the failure of Thomas Brackett Reed's Federal Elections Bill that called for enforcement of the 15th amendment in the South. The namesake of this bill considered it to be the brainchild of William Windom, who had Justin Morrill introduce it into the Senate, and it was attacked by John P. Jones as not going far enough. Democrats who supported the repeal of this act formed a presidential ticket of Simon Bolivar Buckner and John Palmer that received 1% of the vote. Passed in the same legislative package as the McKinley Tariff, the depletion of gold reserves caused by this act led to a bailout of the government by JP Morgan and the repeal of this law by Grover Cleveland.
