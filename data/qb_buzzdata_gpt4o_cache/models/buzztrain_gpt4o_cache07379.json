The prologue to this text opens by citing Matthew 19:28, in a discussion of why one should not judge. It analyzes Boethius's claim in the Topics that accident and substance were the two \"primary kinds of things\" and develops an argument about the prevalence of \"opinion.\" This text adopts the dialectical approach of Gratian in a section that opens with the inquiry of whether human faith must be \"completed by reason\" and goes on to ask whether faith only concerns unseen things, and whether there is any knowledge of unseen things. It states that if \"God permits errors to befall the saints themselves, this occurs in matters which do no harm to the faith,\" and presents 158 questions in an attempt to resolve inconsistencies between church fathers.

  "A text set in this place is framed by Echecrates's questions for a person who was there. An occupant of this place dreams of a woman clad in white who says to go to Phthia three days hence. One conversation in this locale concerns whether tallness is inherent to Simmias, or if Simmias is merely relatively tall compared to others. A woman named Xanthippe breaks down crying in this place, a few days after her husband describes himself as too thoroughly nurtured by his city's laws to defy its judgment against him. This is the setting of a discussion of the immortality of the soul in the Phaedo. For 10 points, name this place from which Crito proposes an escape in his namesake dialogue, where Socrates drank hemlock.": {
