  "This man's dedication to improving the state of his nation's army led him to compose a Soldier's Pocket Book for Field Service, which aided in his promotion to assistant adjutant general. His service under James Hope Grant is recounted in this man's Narrative of the War with China in 1860, and the seizure of the Trent prompted this man to be sent to Canada, where he led the Red River expedition in suppression of the Riel rebellion. This man's more famous deeds were carried out in the East, where he led the expedition that destroyed Kumasi and won a victory at Tall al-Kabir against Urabi Pasha. This man's forces arrived too late to save \"Chinese\" Gordon at Khartoum, but for his efforts he was mad viscount anyway, and as commander-in-chief of all British forces he prosecuted the First Boer War. For ten points, identify this well-traveled British general, whose exploits include bringing the Zulu War to an end and a punitive expeditiong against the Ashanti empire.": {
