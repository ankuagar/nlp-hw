  "This man's namesake field is a massless Proca field. Highly viscous fluids are sometimes characterized by a shear stress damping time known as his relaxation time. He lends his name to several equalities involving second derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, and Boltzmann's H-theorem shows that a gas in thermal equilibrium is characterized by this man's namesake distribution function. In order to preserve charge, he added a term proportional to the time derivative of the electric field to Ampere's law.
