  "Naval forces prepared for one battle in this conflict by massing near Tangier Island. Sackett's Harbor was of strategic importance in this war, which saw the heroics of Laura Secord. Another battle in this conflict occurred after a failed rendezvous with Isaac Chauncey, and saw Gordon Drummond and Phineas Riall win a costly victory. Unrest leading to this war was partly caused by the Orders in Council, and before it, one side gained allies due to a raid on Prophetstown. The Battle of Bladensburg allowed one belligerent to enter the capital of the other.
