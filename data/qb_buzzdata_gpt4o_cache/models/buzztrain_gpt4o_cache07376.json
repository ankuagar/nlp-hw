This chemical was first used to solvate electrons of alkali metals, producing brightly colored solutions.  When Tollens' reagent is prepared for laboratory use, a solution containing this chemical is used to dissolve a precipitate of silver-1 oxide. It is combined with (*) oxygen to produce nitric acid in the Ostwald process, and in humans, this chemical is converted into urea for excretion. One method of producing this chemical uses methane to synthesize hydrogen gas which is then reacted with nitrogen over an iron catalyst, and is called the Haber-Bosch process.
