  "In cryptography, this term describes useful logarithms defined with respect to multiplicative cyclic groups. A probability mass function is defined for random variables described by this term. Random variable of this type must have an associated sample space that is finite or countably infinite. Sampling is used to obtain a signal in this type of time domain. The (*) Poisson, Bernoulli, and binomial probability distributions are all described by this term. The field of mathematics denoted by this term includes the fields of combinatorics and graph theory. For 10 points, name this term which describes random variables that take on distinct and separated values, as opposed to \"continuous\".": {
