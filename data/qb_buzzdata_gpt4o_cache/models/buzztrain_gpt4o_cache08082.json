  "Its value can be derived by applying the Bragg-Williams approximation to a 2-dimensional Ising model, resulting in a mean-field theory. It is given by the coupling constant times the number of nearest neighbors divided by Boltzmann's constant, and Onsager's solutions imply that near it the spontaneous magnetization scales as the one-eighth power of the temperature. TRM occurs when a substance is cooled in the presence of a magnetic field below this point, which has an antiferromagnetic counterpart in the Neel temperature.
