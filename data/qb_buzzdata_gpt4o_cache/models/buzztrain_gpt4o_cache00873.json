  "When one character in this opera admires the Drum Major of the military band, her friend Margaret says that she can \"stare through seven pairs of leather breeches.\"  The Doctor alters the title character's diet as part of an experiment and complains when he coughs in the street \"like a dog\".  The moon rises \"like a bloody sword\" and the title character kills Marie, the mother of his child.  In the final scene, a child riding a hobby-horse learns that his mother is dead.

  "One character in this play tells the fable of \"The Snake and the Fox\" in response to another character's stories about the calf that swallowed ground glass and the cock that wanted to play a dog. This play was inspired by the startling truisms its author discovered while trying to learn English. Two characters in this work kiss after realizing that they live in the same house, sleep in the same bed, and both have a (*) two year old daughter named Alice with one red and one left eye, although the maid Mary informs them that these are different daughters after all. The central couple of this play has a conversation about a family composed entirely of Bobby Watsons before entertaining the Martins and the Fire Chief.

Near the end of this play, one character sneers \"The Mad Scene: Enter Ophelia\" as her mother drags her wedding dress downstairs. The maid Cathleen celebrates the distraction of the characters in this work by drinking all of their liquor. After one character notes that she hates it when her son becomes all gloomy and morbid, he replies by noting \"It's pretty hard to have a dope fiend for a mother,\" referring to her morphine addition which she acquired after the birth of Edmund. A major argument in this play is about the illness of Edmund, who has tuberculosis, and is the son of James and Mary. For 10 points, identify this play about the dissolution of the Tyrone family, the masterwork of Eugene O'Neill.": {

  "One character in this opera sings about his many loves in the aria \"Non so pi\u00f9 cosa son, cosa faccio\" and jumps out of a window after hiding in a closet. That character also sings the aria \"Voi che sapete.\" A pin conveying a secret meeting is lost by Barbarina at the beginning of Act Four. In Act Three, a contract is nullified after it is revealed the title character is the son of Marcellina and Bartolo. In this opera, both the page Cherubino and the Countess Rosina dress up as Susanna, whom Count Almaviva attempts to woo. Susanna is the bride of the title character who, in another work, serves as the Barber of Seville. For 10 points, name this opera by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.": {

  "One character in this play mocks a widowed countess who lost a rib in a horse-riding accident for trying to find a new husband. A controversial speech in this play discusses a gentleman who sells a team of loyal servants who had saved his life for three greyhounds. At the beginning of this play a maid artificially forces a clock to chime to trick a father into believing he had heard the clock playing, while in reality his daughter had been playing a duet with her lover on the piano and flute all night long. A character nicknamed \"The Reticent\" molests the maid Liza after falling off his horse, and one of the main character's romantic rivals is Colonel Skalozub. The protagonist of this play arrives at Pavel Famusov's estate after a three-year absence only to discover that the secretary Molchalin has stolen the heart of his beloved Sofia. For 10 points, name this satiric verse play ending when Chatsky flees Moscow, written by Alexander Griboyedov.": {

  "One character in this work uses a hashish metaphor to counter an accusation that he has done his master more harm than good and is laughed at for using big words during a debate with some southern scholars. That character later stands on some ramparts alone, playing a zither, thus dissuading his rival from following him, while in a different episode that character captured and released a barbarian general seven times. Another character, who rides a horse named Red Hare, betrays and kills the man whom he used to serve as a bodyguard, Dong Zhuo. The victors of the Battle of Xiapi later hang Lu Bu, though before he is killed, he is almost recruited by Cao Cao. For 10 points, name this work by Luo Guanzhong, in which an oath is taken in a peach garden by Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Liu Bei during the Yellow Turban Rebellion.": {

  "One character from this novel describes how he was \"put in\" a fountain of Mercury by friends of Boy Mulcaster, whose sister the protagonist later marries. Another character from this novel is very attached to his teddy bear, Aloysius, and first appears when vomiting into the protagonist's ground-floor rooms. In this novel, the flamboyant Anthony Blanche warns the protagonist of his \"bubbly\" best friend, who becomes an alcoholic and lives his later days at a Tunisian monastery. For 10 points, identify this novel about Charles Ryder's relationship with Sebastian Flyte's Catholic family, written by Evelyn Waugh.": {
