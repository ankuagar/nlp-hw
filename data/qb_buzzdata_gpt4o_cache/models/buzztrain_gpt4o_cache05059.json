  "Near the end of this novel, a foul black substance pours from one character's mouth like vomit, and the protagonist's daughter starts working in a cotton factory. One character is introduced as a boy on his first day of school and is mocked for his outfit and the pronunciation of his name. That man, previously married to Heloise Dubuc, fails in surgery and forces Hippolyte's leg to be amputated. The title character has an affair with Rodolphe Boulanger and then later has an affair with Leon Dupuis. That character ultimately wishes to escape the world and takes arsenic to end her life.
