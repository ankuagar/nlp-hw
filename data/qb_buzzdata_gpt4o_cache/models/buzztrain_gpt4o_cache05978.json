  "In one poem, this poet threatens to send the addressee three hundred more poems if he doesn't return a napkin he stole. A line from this poet is the source of the title of a short story collection edited by Jeffrey Eugenides. He wrote an elegiac couplet whose speaker states \"I hate and I love.\" One of his poems begins, \"Wandering through many countries and over many seas, I come, my brother, to these sorrowful obsequies.\" That poem, which ends with the words \"ave atque vale,\" is addressed to the \"silent ashes\" of his brother. Many of his poems are thought to be addressed to Clodia Metelli. For 10 points, name this Roman poet many of whose poems are about his mistress Lesbia.": {

  "This poem asserts that \"Gertrude, lily, and Luther, are two of a town.\" It describes \"lovely-asunder starlight\" and compares God's mercy to the way a \"sloe/ Will, mouthed to flesh-burst,/ Gush!\", and claims Christ will make sure its subjects will \"bathe in his fall-gold mercies.\" It ends by noting \"Our heart's charity's hearth's fire, our thoughts's chivalry's throng's Lord\" and claims that the Catholic church shall rise in England once again. In this poem, \"O Christ, Christ, come quickly\" is the cry of the \"lioness,\" the tallest of the people memorialized. It is dedicated to the \"happy memory\" of a group exiled by the Falk laws of Bismarck's kulturkampf, five Franciscan nuns who died in a blizzard near the mouth of the Thames. For 10 points, name this long poem about the title vessel run aground, written by Gerard Manley Hopkins.": {
