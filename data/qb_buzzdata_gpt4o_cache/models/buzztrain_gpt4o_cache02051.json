  "The first of these objects was discovered in 1920, but was not classified until the 1970s. That object was Hidalgo. Recently, the first binary pair of these objects was discovered. It consists of Echidna and Typhon. Charles Kowal discovered the first of these objects, which was later reclassified after the discovery of ice-jets emanating from it. The unstable orbits of these bodies are caused by the perturbation of a nearby planet. These bodies are believed to originate in the Kuiper Belt and examples of them include Echeclus, Chariklo, and Chiron. They exhibit behavior that is in some ways a hybrid of asteroids and comets, hence their name.
