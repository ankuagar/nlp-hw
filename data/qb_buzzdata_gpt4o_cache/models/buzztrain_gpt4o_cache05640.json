  "The originator of this legend may have been Heliodorus, the chancellor of Seleucus IV Philopatorm, who was prevented by the priest Onias from looting the Temple. A similar story from a cuneiform tablet lends veracity to this legend, which is set during the years following the victory at Carchemish by Nebuchadnezzar. Three Talmudic units of weight, the peras, shekel, and mina, have been hypothesized to be represented. After \"the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone\" are praised at a banquet, the central event occurs and the inability to vocalize three verbs meaning \"to count,\" \"to weigh,\" and \"to divide\" render an inscription undecipherable. Depicted in the fifth chapter of Daniel, this is, FTP, what harbinger that, according to the prophet, foretold the downfall of King Belshazzar of Babylon?": {

  "The origins of the modern parliament can be traced to the rule of this royal house, during which the Model Parliament was formed. Its first ruler held the throne concurrently with his second son for thirteen years; that son was married to Margaret, daughter of Louis VII of France, at age five so his father could reacquire the Norman Vexin. It originated with the marriage of (*) Geoffrey, Count of Anjou, to Matilda, the daughter of Henry I. The descendants of Edward III's third and fourth sons, John of Gaunt and Edmund of Langley, respectively formed its cadet houses of Lancaster and York.
