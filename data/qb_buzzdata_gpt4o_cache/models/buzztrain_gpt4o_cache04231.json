  "In the laboratory, this substance is used to pre-wet PVDF membranes for western blotting, and the transfer buffer for that procedure is 20% this substance. The product of the reaction between this compound and hydrogen iodide is bound to an iridium-containing catalyst in the first step of the Cativa process, which carbonylates this compound. Reacting this compound with isobutylene creates the anti-knock agent MBTE, and it is also used to trans-esterify triglycerides to form biodiesel. Ingesting this compound can cause high anion-gap acidosis and blindness, which is prevented by inhibiting ALDH. This compound can be oxidized twice to create formic acid or once to create formaldehyde. It was originally distilled form wood by Robert Boyle. For 10 points, name this simplest alcohol with formula CH2OH.": {
