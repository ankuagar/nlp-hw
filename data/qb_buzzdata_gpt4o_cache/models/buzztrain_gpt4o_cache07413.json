  "The theoretical prediction of this particle was made in a 1970 paper by Glashow, Iliopoulos, and Maiani, who connected its proposed existence to the number of then-known lepton generations. The schematic representation of particles incorporating this particle can be seen by extending the baryon decuplet to a three-dimensional pyramid. Confirmation for the existence of this particle was provided by the discovery of the D-meson, in which this particle is found with an up or down anti-quark, and the lambda-plus baryon.

  "His theory of history claimed that new movements arise out of the contradictions in their forerunners in his talkings, posthumously published as Lectures on the Philosophy of History. Strongly influenced by Jakob Bohme, his idea of sublation between propositions was outlined in his The Science of Logic, and he divided the mind into \"subjective,\" \"objective,\" and \"absolute\" categories in his three-part work Philosophy of Right.
