  "Reinhardt and Clark researched an analog of this effect in the collisions of Bose\u2013Einstein condensates, and Andreev bound states can contribute to it. An example of the internal type of this effect is the longitudinal NMR in super- fluid helium. It allows a precise determination of the ratio e/h, and this effect can exist in AC and DC varieties. This basis for a SQUID can detect very small magnetic fields and was predicted by its namesake 22-year-old Brit.
