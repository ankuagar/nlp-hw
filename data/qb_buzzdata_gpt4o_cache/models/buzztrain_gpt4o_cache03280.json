  "In the introduction to the second edition of this work, the author described how Hubert Humphrey won a 1948 Senate race over a man who championed the ideas of Jeremy Bentham. It criticizes the inability of monetary policy to have any influence on wage-price interactions in a chapter called \"The Monetary Illusion,\" while chapter 11 of this work criticizes consumer wants which arise from \"the process of satisfying wants\" and calls it the \"dependence effect.\" Another chapter criticizes the use of GDP and GNP as a measure of quality of life and is titled \"The Paramount Position of Production.\" Its author originally titled it \"Why the Poor are Poor\" and discarded another title which described the central entity as \"opulent\" and its second chapter contains an attack on a concept which espouses \"predictability\" over \"originality\" and preaches \"what the audience most wants to hear,\" conventional wisdom.
