  "At one point in this story, one character tells another that he has a lot of luck and that he \"ought to play the races.\" That exchange is followed by another character visiting Hirsch's rooming house where that character encounters a man lying on a bed \"with all his clothes on.\" Later, another figure speculates that the man lying in the bed must have been mixed up with something in Chicago. The first scene is set at a location with a long mirror that runs along the counter and had once been a bar. It opens with a man ordering a roast pork tenderloin with applesauce, at which point he is told that he can't have said item until dinner. After this response, the workers, including Sam, the black cook, are harassed by two identically dressed men in suits named Max and Al, who turn out to be the title figures. It ends with George, the proprietor of Henry's Lunch Room, discussing the fate of an old Swedish boxer with its young protagonist, who is also featured in such stories as \"Cross Country Snow\" and \"Big Two Hearted River.\" For 10 points, identify this Nick Adams tale, a work about the impending murder of Ole Andreson by Ernest Hemingway.": {
