  "At the beginning of the work this character appears in, he is described as having clumps of yellowish hair protruding from his ears and is said to be fond of chewing on herbs, which may explain his frequent moments of inertia. Near the end of the work, he calls an opponent \"the Devil\" because he is \"faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt.\" This character's old job has been taken over by Bernard Gui, who persecutes Salvatore and Remigio. This character eventually confronts an old man who hates (*) laughter and has used poisoned pages to conceal Aristotle's writing on comedy. This opponent of Jorge of Burgos is accompanied by the narrator of the book he appears in, a novice named Adso of Melk. For 10 points, name this Franciscan who investigates the murder of monks in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose.": {

  "It begins with an \"Author's Preface\" that takes place at Shawmut College and was inspired by the work of Laurence Gronlund. As the novel progresses the protagonist falls in love with the doctor's daughter who is a descendant of Edith Bartlett and gets thrown out of a society dinner in Boston for informing the diners about poverty in the city. Other characters in this work, that spawned the sequel Equality, include Drs. Pillsbury and Leete, as well as the manservant Sawyer, who perishes in a fire. The protagonist, who was hypnotized in an underground sleeping chamber wakes up in the twentieth century. For 10 points, name this novel about Julian West's adventures in the future, a work of Edward Bellamy.": {
