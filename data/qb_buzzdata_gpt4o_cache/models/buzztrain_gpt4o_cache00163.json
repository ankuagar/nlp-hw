  "A 2003 album named for this instrument's \"evolution\" contains nineteen tracks each in the style of a different master of it and was recorded by Arturo Sandoval. Another player of this instrument became the subject of Benny Golson's \"I Remember Clifford\" after dying in a car crash at the age of 25. It is also played by the Lincoln Center jazz director who composed the jazz oratorio Blood on the Fields. This instrument of Clifford Brown and Wynton Marsalis was played by a bandleader whose hits \"Salt Peanuts\" and \"A Night in Tunisa\" led him to be considered a cofounder of the bebop style along with saxophonist Charlie Parker. For 10 points, Dizzy Gillespie played a \"bent\" version of what instrument which was also played by Louis Armstrong?": {
