  "Experimental verification of one part of this statement came when a compound synthesized by Richard Willstatter was found to decolorize solutions of potassium permanganatel, and important research on its reversal was done by Baird. Systems that are contrasted with those that obey this statement are known as Mobius systems, and systems that do obey it have an even number of sign inversions and can only participate in thermal pericyclic reactions is a condition similar to this statement is satisfied. The namesake of this statement also lends his name to a theory of activity coefficients with Debye. This statement explains why cyclopentadiene is highly acidic, and 10-annulene compounds are not subject to it ebcause they are not planar. For 10 points, name this rule that coplanar monocyclic rings are aromatic only if they contain 4n+2 delocalized pi electrons, named after a German chemist.": {
