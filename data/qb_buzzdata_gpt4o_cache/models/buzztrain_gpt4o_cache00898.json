  "Citing this action, Unamuno concluded that \"From our actions, not from our contemplation, will we gain wisdom.\" Detailed pictures on a blackboard were drawn in defense of this action by Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote a set of lectures on the work in which it happens. Just before this action happens, its perpetrator says that \"fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves.\" This action, which forms Chapter VIII of the first book in the work it is part of, is followed up by its perpetrator tearing a bough from a nearby oak to fashion a replacement lance for one that got damaged piercing the sails of the title objects. It happens because one character sees thirty or more giants on a flat plain and brashly charges over the protests of Sancho Panza.
