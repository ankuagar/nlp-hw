  "One of this director's movies begins with a child turning on TV to find a doctor examining a stutterer. A writer travels to Italy where he meets a madman who wants to walk over a mineral spring while holding a lit candle and sets himself on fire while playing Beethoven's 9th in his film Nostalghia. The title character of one of his films serves a guide who leads The Professor and The Writer through a dangerous region called \"The Zone\" to a secret room that will grant people their deepest wishes. Along with Mirror and Stalker this director made a film about an artist who breaks his vow of silence to speak to a boy who miraculously is able to cast a working bell after lying to villagers he knew how to construct one. In another film Dr. Kris Kelvin encounters reincarnations of his dead wife Hari while staying aboard a space station observing the titular planet that has the power to project hallucinations.
