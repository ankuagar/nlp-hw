  "A cyclical five-carbon member of this class of compounds is called tetrahydropyran, which can be used as a protecting group. Aryl versions of this functional group can be made in the Ullmann condensation, while cyclic ones can result from the oxidation of an alkene with a peroxyacid. Asymmetric ones are often formed by a reaction that uses a strong base to deprotonate an alcohol, which can then serve as a nucleophile in an SN2 reaction; that reaction is called the Williamson synthesis of these. For ten points, identify this functional group in which an oxygen is singly bonded to two different carbon atoms.": {
