This ballet contains a dream sequence in which the title character murders a gigantic spider, causing its web to transform into a magical garden. A completely unfaithful adaptation of this ballet, with music by Vladimir Nabokov's cousin Nicolas, starred Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine in the lead roles. A new character called the Dryad Queen was added in a revival of this ballet by Alexander Gorsky, who spliced in the \"Grand pas de (*) toreadors\" from the choreographer's later ballet Zoraiya. The final scene of this ballet includes a grand pas de deux danced by the innkeeper's daughter Kitri and her barber lover Basilio, or Basil. Act II, Scene II of this ballet consists of the protagonist intimidating gypsies at a marionette theater performance, followed by him tilting at some windmills.
