  "After catching a cold during a balloon ascent he was forced to end his service in the Franco-Prussian War, after which he was reprimanded by the duke of Cambridge because his service was a violation of British neutrality.  He was shot in the jaw during his campaigns against the slave trader Osman Digna, while his image as a \"man of destiny\" was forwarded by a popular book written by G. W. Steevens.  It was rumored that he was not dead but sleeping in a cave in the Hebrides after the HMS Hampshire, which was taking him on a secret mission to Russia, was sunk by a German mine in 1916.  Named Secretary of State for War during the Asquith ministry, a recruitment campaign using his image saw three million people enlist, including a million volunteers who comprised his namesake army, which was also called the \"New Army.\"  He was serving as sirdar of the Egyptian army when he won a victory at Omdurman and met Captain Marchand at Fashoda.  FTP, name this general, who also led British forces to victory in the Boer War.": {

That man with this last name legendarily grabbed the dagger Lucretia used to kill herself and subsequently overthrew (*) Tarquin the Proud, the last King of Rome. His descendant, also with this last name, was taken prisoner at the Battle of Pharsalus and ultimately killed at the Second Battle of Philippi.
