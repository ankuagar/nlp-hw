  "This man discussed the relevance of neurons of the title creature being boiled alive in an essay about a lobster and its role in pleasing humans. One of this author's stories begins with a man making a witticism and a girl laughing, both trying to be liked. Another story is about a sadomasochistic Young Republican Lawyer who is happy with Gimlet and Tit but not Boltpin, before we learn he likes to burn people with a cigarette lighter. In addition to writing \"A Radically Condensed History of Postindustrial Life\" and \"The Girl with Curious Hair,\" one of his novels sees a character listen to the relevance of a pen sketch of a barber with an exploded head from a man called the Anti-Christ.
