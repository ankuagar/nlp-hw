Following her rescue, rumors abound that she slept with the Demon King, and she disappears into the earth after maintaining she was faithful to her husband.

  "In one variation of this experiment, John Wheeler considered a thought experiment in which the choice whether to measure the output is delayed until after the experiment begins. It has nothing to do with Bell's theorem, but a variation of this experiment involving a BBO crystal and a coincidence detector involves measuring entagled states, known as the quantum eraser. Claus Johnsson performed this experiment with electrons, and modifications of in which the apparatus is partially closed off are used to show the principle of complementarity. Classically, the results of this experiment can be derived by noting that the pattern occurs when the path lengths differ by multiples one-half the wavelength of the incident light. Usually explained using Huygens' principle, for 10 points, name this experiment used to demonstrate the wave nature of light, in which light passing through the namesake apparatus creates a series of fringes.": {

  "One variety of this technique uses the Xcorr score as a quality metric. This technique is the last step of MudPIT analysis, and the Orbitrap and FTICR are two different configurations of instruments used in it. One way to prepare the sample dissolves it in a liquid of low vapor pressure before bombarding it with high energy xenon or argon atoms, called fast atom bombardment, or FAB. A gamma hydrogen may transfer to a carbonyl or an alkene during this technique via the McLafferty rearrangement. Molecules with a carbon 13 atom show an M+1 peak, while molecules with chlorine or bromine show isotope peaks.
