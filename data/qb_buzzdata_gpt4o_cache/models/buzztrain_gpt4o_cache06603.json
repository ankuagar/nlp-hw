A set of beings feared by this belief system cannot distinguish between truth and falsehood, known as asha and druj.

  "This relationship predicts the existence of creep waves, which are less useful than Rayleigh waves for nondestructive testing. The boundary conditions of Maxwell's equations, along with Fermat's principle of least time, may be used to derive it, and a quantity named for Brewster can be calculated from this law assuming complete reflection. Involved in the derivation of the critical angle, this relationship predicts an angle of fifty degrees will produce total internal reflection at a water-air boundary. For 10 points, identify this relationship which determines how the angle at which light enters and exits a boundary changes due change in refractive index.": {

Its second day celebrates the death of an evil demon, while its fourth day is devoted to the goddess of wealth. Mahavira attained nirvana during this holiday, making it sacred to the Jains, while another group celebrates the return of a king from fourteen years of exile.
