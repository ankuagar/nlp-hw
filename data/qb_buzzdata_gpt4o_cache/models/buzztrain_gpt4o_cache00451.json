  "Benioff zones counterbalance this process that Dietz described independently of Hess. When this process moves slowly, fracture zones and pseudofaults are created. Paleomagnetism studies have demonstrated that this process produced stripes of alternating magnetic alignments as the Earth's magnetic field shifted. Continental drift is a result of this process in which basaltic magma rises due to convection forces near mid-oceanic ridges and is subducted at trenches. For 10 points, name this process of the creation of new crust in the ocean.": {
