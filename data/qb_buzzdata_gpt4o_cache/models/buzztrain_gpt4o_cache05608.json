  "This opera quotes a theme from Tristan and Isolde over one's character's announcement of his unwillingness to play the role of King Mark. Its second act largely takes place between a watchman's announcement of 10 and 11 o'clock, and features a hammer and the song \"Jerum! Jerum!\" being used to drown out the antagonist's serenade. This opera's first act includes Pogner's Address and its subplots include the (*) apprentice David's affections for Magdalane. One of the central characters in this opera sings about the chaotic nature of the world in the aria \"Wahn! Wahn! Uberall Wahn,\" before helping another character transcribe his dream into the \"Prize Song.\" The cobbler Hans Sachs helps Walther win the love of Eva in, for 10 points, which Richard Wagner opera about a singing contest.": {
