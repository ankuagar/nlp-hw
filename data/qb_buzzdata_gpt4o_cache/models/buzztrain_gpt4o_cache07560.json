  "It isn't a Treaty of Paris, but this agreement signed in a primate's palace was the fourth peace accord signed in its namesake city. The independence of Liguria and the annexation of Tuscany were two provisions from earlier treaties that this agreement affirmed. The King of Bavaria, the King of Wurttemberg, and the Elector of Baden were among the European rulers who received land under this agreement; the losers were forced to pay an indemnity of 40 million francs and Francis I was forced to both give up all hope of ever being Holy Roman Emperor again and pull out of the Third Coalition.
