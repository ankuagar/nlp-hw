  "This book labels the choice between dogmatism, infinite regress, and psychologism the \"trilemma of Fries,\" and resolves that problem by asserting the need to stop at accepted \"basic statements.\" Its eighth chapter builds on the work of Richard von Mises to develop a frequency theory of probability. This book proposes an experiment involving a monochromatic beam of particles to rebut the idea that \"precise single predictions are impossible\" in its section \"Some Observations on Quantum Theory.\" It argues that \"universal\" statements cannot be disproven by \"existential\" ones, and attempts to replace inductive theories with deductive ones that rely on testing by corroboration. For 10 points, name this book which asserts that theories are only rigorous if they are falsifiable, written by Karl Popper.": {
