  "This event was preceded by the kil ing of Robert de Comines, and in exchange for assistance during this  event, Ilbert de Lacy was granted the land that would later become Pontefract castle. Prior to this event,  a city being held by Wil iam Malet and Gilbert de Grant was captured by a force bolstered by Danes under  the command of the sons of Sweyn II, who would later be bought off with tribute by the perpetrator of  this event. This event caused Bishop Ethelwine to withdraw his clerical community to Lindisfarne, and  according to Orderic Vitalis, more than 100,000 people died of starvation during this event, which affected  the area between York and Durham. Prompted by a Northumbrian revolt in support of Edgar Aetheling,  for 10 points, identify this scorched-earth campaign of punishment in carried out in the eponymous part  of England in 1069 and 1070 by Wil iam the Conqueror.": {
