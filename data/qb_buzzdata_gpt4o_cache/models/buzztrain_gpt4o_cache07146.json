This had lead to a feminist reading of the work, connecting the author's identification of nature as female to his deaf sister. The speaker notes \"let the moon shine on thee in thy solitary walk\" in this work, which mentions \"steep woods and lofty cliffs, and this green pastoral landscape\" towards its end.

  "The speaker of one of these poems by this author asserts that \"I am gall. I am heartburn\" and notes that \"Selfyeast of spirit a dull dough sours\". Another of these poems by this author asks \"Comforter, where, where is your comforting?\" and opens with the line \"No worst, there is none.\" The speaker of another of these poems asks \"O thou terrible, why wouldst thou rude on me / thy wring-world right foot rock? lay a lionlimb against me?\" and refuses to \"untwist--slack they may be--these last strands of man\". The aforementioned works, including \"Carrion Comfort\", are among the six written during their author's time in Dublin that are known as the \"terrible\" ones, while their author also developed an eleven-line type of them he called the \"curtal\" version. For 10 points, identify this genre of works by a certain author, including one which states \"Glory be to God for dappled things\" and is titled \"Pied Beauty\".": {
