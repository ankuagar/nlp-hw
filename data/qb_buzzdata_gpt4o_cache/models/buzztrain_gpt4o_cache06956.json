  "This scientist predicted the critical temperature of helium using his law of corresponding states. The isotherms predicted by an equation named for him were modified by Maxwell's equal area rule. That equation named for this man uses the parameters \"a\" and \"b\" to correct for molecular size and molecular interactions. London dispersion forces and dipole-dipole interactions are types of his namesake forces. For 10 points, name this Dutch scientist, the namesake of a modification of the ideal gas law as well as some weak forces that contribute to intermolecular bonding.": {
