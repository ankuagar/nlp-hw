  "This clash was preceded by a so-called \"impecable siege\" of Pir-Sar at Aornos, and was decided after Coenus swept up the loser's right flank, defeating the losing army's cavalry away from their main line. The assistance provided by Omphis prior to this battle prompted Malayketu lifelong hatred by for Taxila. The experiences of the winning side here prompted wariness of Magadhan forces that led to a later event at the Beas. In the wake of this battle, Nikaia was founded along with another city named for its most famous casualty, Bucephalus.

  "This man claimed that when blind belief \"ceases it is shattered like a glass whose fragments can not be again reunited except by being cast again into the furnace and refashioned.\" He argued against corporeal resurrection by comparing it to the transformation of iron into a garment. He used a fourfold structure of three maqam, one of which is split into two maslak, to present an occasionalist defense of the possibility of miracles in the seventeenth section of one work; that occasionalist position was tribute to his teacher al-Juwaynii, an Asharite. His most famous work draws on the positions of John Philoponous for its first section, which refutes doctrines of \"pre-eternity\" and \"post-eternity\" in the works of al-Farabi and Avicenna. For 10 points, name this author of Revival of the Religious Sciences and Deliverance from Error, a Sufi who also wrote The Incoherence of the Philosophers.": {

  "A classic introductory text in this discipline was co-written by George Edward Hughes and his student Max Creswell. Quine devised three levels of involvement in this discipline, objecting to introducing quantification at the third, but his concerns were put solidly to rest by Ruth Barcan Marcus and her formula. The Finnish philosopher G.H. von Wright extended this discipline to ethics, founding a \"deontic\" variant of it. This discipline grew out of the S4 and S5 systems of (*) Clarence Irving Lewis, who originated the notion of strict implication. It's not philosophy of language, but the distinction between vivid and rigid designators is crucial to this discipline.
