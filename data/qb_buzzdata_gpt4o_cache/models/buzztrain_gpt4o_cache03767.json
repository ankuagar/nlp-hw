  "In a 1992 jury trial, a scheme to allow protection of 37 individuals, called the \"Plan B\" type of this status, was found to violate antitrust law. A proposed \"16th-man\" compensation to offset the loss of people who achieved and utilized this status led to labor unrest in 1981. Restrictions that stalled a move from Liege to Dunkerque were struck down under Article 39 of the EC Treaty in the 1995 Bosman ruling, which mandated that certain people be allowed to achieve this status in Europe. In another context, individuals were allowed to achieve this status in the Seitz decision after a challenge by Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally. In that realm, this status was demanded in a letter declaring \"I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes\" directed to Bowie Kuhn, who refused to allow this status by upholding the reserve clause system. For 10 points, name this status that Curt Flood demanded so that he could negotiate his next contract with whatever baseball team he chose.": {
