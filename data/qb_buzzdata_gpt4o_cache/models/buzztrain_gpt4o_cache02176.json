  "Fred Dutton, Herb Barman, and Lloyd Davis briefly held spots during the formative period of this group, which made its home at the Blackhawk night club. Jazz: Red, Hot, and Cool was one of their last albums before drummer Joe Dodge left in favor of Joe Morello, which also led to Eugene Wright becoming the new bassist. Primarily led by Paul Desmond and their eponymous pianist, they struck it big with an album that featured \"Pick up Sticks,\" \"Blue Rondo a la Turk,\" and a piece that famously used 5/4 time. FTP, name this long-running jazz foursome whose album Time Out featured the hit \"Take Five.\"": {
