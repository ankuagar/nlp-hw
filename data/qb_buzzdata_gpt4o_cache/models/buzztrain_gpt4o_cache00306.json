  "This author denounced V. S. Naipaul for identifying with wealthy, modernized countries, and contrasted him with Narayan's interest in the people of Malgudi in his essay \"Today, a Balance of Stories.\" He described a boy ashamed of writing about the harmattan in an essay about the function of the author, \"The Novelist as Teacher.\" This author wrote that \"art for art's sake is just another piece of deodorized dog-shit\" and argued that Armah's novel The Beautyful Ones are Not Yet Born ignores the sickness of Ghana for the sickness of the modern world in \"Africa and Her Writers.\" This founding editor of the literary magazine Okike wrote a novel in which Odo prostitutes his daughter Edna for money paid by Nanga, who maneuvers to win an election over Odili Samalu. The protagonist of another of his novels wins a scholarship from the UPU before returning to Lagos and taking bribes to pay for the abortion of his girlfriend Clara.
