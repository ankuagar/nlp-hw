  "Like Hanukkah, this holiday features the addition of the Al-Ha-Nissim to the daily prayers. The charity obligatory on this day is known as \"mattanot la-evyonim.\" On this holiday, bizarre questions about Jewish law are asked in this holiday's namesake form of Torah. At the Seudat meal on this day, one is supposed to be unable to tell \"arur\" from \"baruch.\" This holiday is when the \"misloach manot\" gift baskets are handed out, and this holiday in the month of Adar is when gragers are used to drown out the name of Haman. For 10 points, name this holiday where Jews get drunk and wear costumes to celebrate Esther and Mordechai's end to a Persian genocide plot.": {
