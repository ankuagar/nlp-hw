  "The premiere of his Opus 4, an orchestral setting of texts by the insane poet Peter Altenberg, featured a riot and came to be known as the \"Scandal Concert.\" He quoted a Carinthian folksong and Bach's chorale \"Es ist genus\" in the Violin Concerto he wrote following the death from polio of Walter Gropius's daughter Manon, and he himself received a fatal sting from an insect just after finishing the piece.  His Chamber Concerto was the first of his works to have a secret program, being based on ciphers of three names, while his adulterous affair with the sister of Franz Werfel is the secret program of his Lyric Suite. He also wrote two operas, one based on a play by Wedekind and the other on a play by Buchner. FTP, name this composer of Lulu and Wozzeck.": {
