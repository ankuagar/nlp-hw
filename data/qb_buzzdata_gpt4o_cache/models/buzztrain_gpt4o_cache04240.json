  "In of this man's large works which drew upon Egyptian mythology contains a \"fulfillment\" section, and was executed for the Palais Stoclet. Another of his paintings shows a red-haired woman curled in a fetal position who smiles in a contended manner as a shower of gold flows down her thighs. In addition to that depiction of Danae, he painted depictions of \"Lavisciousness, Wantonness, and Intemperance\" and \"The Three Gorgons\" which are flanked by depictions of \"Suffering of Humanity\" and a \"choir of angels\" for another exhibition. That work was inaugurated along Gustav Mahler conducting the titular artist's Ninth Symphony. In addition to painting Beethoven Frieze, he also painted two portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer and depicted a man decorated with rectangles and a woman decorated with circles as they embrace.
