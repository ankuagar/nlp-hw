  "In this work's final chapter, we learn that Saint Paul didn't condemn lawsuits as such, but only objected to the excessive litigiousness of the Corinthians.  In book 1, the author offers the fact that Moses says bad things about his ancestors as a \"rational proof\" of the veracity of Scripture.  Its final book includes chapters on the misery of taking vows rashly, a discussion of five ceremonies that are \"falsely called sacraments,\" and a defense of paedobaptism.  It consists of four books in all, which consider God the father, Christ the redeemer, the Holy Spirit as man's bond to Christ, and the Church.  In the dedication addressed to King Francis, the author explains his reasons for leaving France.  FTP, name this work by John Calvin.": {

  "This work claims that it is impossible to derive that two lines cannot contain space from the definitions of a straight line and the number two. Its author believes that one can never know the empirical ego, since the mind can only experience itself through filtered perception, the transcendental ego. This work posits a phenomenal and a noumenal world, the latter of which is unknowable. It argues that the mind uses twelve categories, including causality, to interpret and impose order on the world, and claims that a priori knowledge can be either analytic or synthetic.

  "In this work, one character explains his use of the words \"azures\" and \"ceruleans\" instead of \"blue\" in his poem, which takes second prize to a work by Dr. Aita. In its postscript, the narrator explains that Captain Burton's manuscript suggests that the title entity on Garay Street was actually false. Opening with the narrator recalling that April thirtieth was the birthday of his former lover, this work sees its narrator visit his cousin, who leads the narrator into his cellar to lie on a sack, where he is able to see, in a \"small iridescent sphere,\" the multitudes of America, a sunset in Quer\u00e9taro, the bones of Beatriz Viterbo--in short, the unimaginable universe.

  "In one work by this writer, the speaker claims not to have the \"tenderer- than-thou/Political collectivistic love\", but spares a mite's life, noting \"how glad\" he is \"to find/On any sheet the least display of mind\" in \"A Considerable Speck\". A dialogue written by this author sees one figure become distressed after the other wonders aloud about the conditions necessary for wood to rot, claiming \"I saw you from the window there\" after the latter figure sets his spade in the kitchen. That work ends with the furious line (*) \"I'll follow and bring you back by force\" and is an autobiographical depiction of a couple's fight following the death of their infant son, while, while in another work, the arguments over Latin and education between Harold and the title figure are described in a conversation by Mary and Warren, before the latter comes to the titular realization regarding Silas. In addition to \"Home Burial\" and \"Death of a Hired Man\", this poet described the effects of ice storms and young boys' swinging on the titular trees in \"Birches\" and thought of joking about Elves with his fence-loving neighbor in another work.
