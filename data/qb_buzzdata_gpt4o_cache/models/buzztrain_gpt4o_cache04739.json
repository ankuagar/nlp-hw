  "This military leader's early career was spent fighting imperialists in the War of the Farrapos, or Tatters. This man, who retired to his semi-private island of Caprera, told Abraham Lincoln he would join the Union side of the Civil War if the war shifted focus to abolishing slavery. This crusader for Uruguayan independence led the \"Expedition of the Thousand\" and had an uneasy relationship with the Piedmont-Sardinian Prime Minister, Count Cavour.
