  "In an equation derived by O'Brien and Hunter, the dimensionless form of this quantity is multiplied by three-halves. This quantity times pressure difference times the square of the capillary radius, divided by the viscosity and capillary length, is directly proportional to the streaming current of a capillary. This property can be measured by observing the electric sonic amplitude caused by an oscillating electric field. This is the main quantity that opposes the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the sedimentation test. This quantity is often confused with a similar one named for Oscar (*) Stern, which is measured at the Stern layer. Microelectrophoresis and electrophoretic light scattering are used in a form of titration in which this property serves as the indicator. This quantity is measured at the slipping plane of the interfacial double layer. Rapid coagulation or flocculation takes place when this quantity is between 0 to 5 mV.
