  "The website of an artists' collective in support of this movement was inexplicably replaced with a single page displaying the text NOT FOR PUBLICATION after they published an article criticizing the Vitoi group. Dr. John Robertson carried out a year-long study demonstrating that the media was biased against this movement. Many supporters of this movement were unsatisfied by the conciliatory recommendations produced by the Smith Commission. Pro-disarmament members of this movement released the report Nowhere to Go, recommending the removal of Trident missiles from the Coulport weapons depot. (*) Nicola Sturgeon was the only candidate left to stand for the leadership of a political party in support of this movement, after the sudden resignation of Alex Salmond. Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband put aside their differences to oppose this movement. This movement was opposed by the Better Together faction, and lost in a referendum that took place in September 2014.
