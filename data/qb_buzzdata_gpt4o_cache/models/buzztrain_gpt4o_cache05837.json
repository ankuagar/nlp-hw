  "This person wrote the incidental music for his own play Medusa's Trap. Some of his music had unusual musical instructions written in red ink such as \"Light as an egg\" or \"Here comes the lantern\", and there is some debate over whether or not his piece Vexations is supposed to be played eight hundred forty times in succession. This composer titled several of his pieces Ogives, a term otherwise only used in architecture, and Gnossiennes, a term he made up. One of his goals was to write what he called \"furniture music\", which is meant to be played in the background, and his best known works are three piano pieces published in 1888 that were orchestrated by his close friend Claude Debussy.
