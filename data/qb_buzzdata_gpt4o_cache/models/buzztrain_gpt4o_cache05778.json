  "A parallel approach to this algorithm requires only n over two iterations and is known as either alternating or odd-even.  One optimization to this algorithm is the Cocktail approach, while it is improved significantly with the Combing approach because the turtles that normally slow down this algorithm move faster because they're compared with elements far apart. Although it shares a Big O of n squared runtime with Insertion Sort, it is typically much slower for randomized data.

One character in this novel keeps a strange coffin in the shape of a canoe, and another character nails a golden coin to the mast of a ship. The Rachel saves the narrator of this novel, who began his life as a schoolteacher. That narrator meets the the harpooner Queequeg before setting sail on the Pequod. For 10 points, name this novel narrated by Ishmael, in which Captain Ahab is destroyed by the titular white whale, by Herman Melville.": {
