  "Deviations from this equation are modeled by an equation which includes a term proportional to the log of the current density, and when that deviation is low, the Stern Geary equation modifies this equation. Another modification of this equation predicts that current will increase exponentially with applied voltage, and this equation corrects for the fact that the concentrations of reactants are seldom at one molar. This equation is modified by the Tafel and the Butler-Volmer equations. This equation calculates the change in potential as RT over nF times the ln of the reaction quotient. For 10 points, name this equation that calculates the reduction or oxidation potential of one half cell.": {
