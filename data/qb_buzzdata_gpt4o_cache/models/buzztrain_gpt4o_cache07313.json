  "During talks over this treaty, the U.S. separately negotiated the Chester concession for economic development, which would later be annulled. The related articles to this treaty were later superseded by the Montreaux Convention. This agreement included a list of 150 who were declared \"persona non grata,\" mostly members of the previous government, though 600 names had originally been submitted to the conference that produced this treaty. An earlier treaty signed at the same location was also called the Treaty of Ouchy, and ended the Italo-Turkish War in 1912. By this treaty, the Dodecanese were ceded to Italy, Hatay was confirmed as Syrian territory, and a massive population exchange was agreed upon with Greece. This agreement, which was a re-negotiation of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres, allowed more hopitable terms to the newly-formed Republic of Turkey than those posed to the Ottomans.
