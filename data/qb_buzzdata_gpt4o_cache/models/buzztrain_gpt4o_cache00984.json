  "The contribution to this quantity by spin waves in a ferromagnet arises from a k-squared dispersion relation. An early model of this quantity fails to predict third power low temperature dependence because it assumes every atom is an independent harmonic oscillator. One relation approximates this quantity in the high (*) temperature limit as three times Boltzmann's constant times particle number; that model, named for Debye, improved the Dulong-Petit law relating this quantity from crystal lattice vibrations. The ideal gas constant is equal to the difference between this quantity calculated at constant pressure and at constant volume.
