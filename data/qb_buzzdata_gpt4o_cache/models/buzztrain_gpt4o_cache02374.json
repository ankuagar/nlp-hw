  "One general at this battle personally led the 57th Brigade into battle, after which General Rapp feared him dead and assumed command until General Davout reappeared alive. The center of the defender's lines in this battle contained a huge cannon-protecting earthworks called the Raevsky Redoubt. An important stronghold for the eventual losers of this battle was the left-flank \"Bagration fl\u00e8ches.\" Prince Eugene commanded the Italy Corps in this battle, the defending forces at which were organized by Count Barclay de Tolly. The victors at the battle failed to take the offensive after they scattered Mikhail Kutuzov's troops.

  "Genera in this phylum include Haemonchus, Necator, Ancylostoma, and Trichuris. These creatures' ameoboid sperm is believed to be the only eukaryotic cell without G-actin, and they mate through the use of a chitin- coated spicule and often with the aid of specially bent tails. To avoid dessication, their epidermis secretes a keratin cuticle, which also means that they molt. Some also have cilia, but all move primarily through their hydrostatic skeleton. Sensory structures called phasmids can be found near their anus, which serves as the end of the pseudocoel of these triploblastic creatures, which include biological superstar C. elegans.
