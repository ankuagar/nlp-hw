  "Although this work was originally choreographed by Julius Reisinger, it was revived by a now-standard version choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. This work includes a succession of Hungarian, Spanish, and Neapolitan dances at a central ball which take place after the protagonist goes hunting with Benno. After mistakenly swearing his love for Odile, the daughter of the bird-sorcerer Von Rothbart, Prince Siegfried drowns himself to escape his oath. For 10 points, name this ballet in which Odette is transformed into the title animal, a work of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.": {
