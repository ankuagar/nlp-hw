  "In one story, this figure's vision was restored with gazelle milk after he was forced to hide out in a pair of oases, while in another story, he led his followers in harpooning 651 crocodiles and hippopotami outside the town of Edfu. He was occasionally depicted sitting atop a lotus flower holding his thumb to his mouth. His hands were once recovered in a trap created by Sobek, who also saved this deity's four sons, who protected canopic jars. His incarnation as the rising sun was transformed into the Greek god of silence Harpocrates, while his teardrop-marked \"eye\" was represented by the goddess Wadjet. This god's exploits include disguising a stone boat and ejaculating into some lettuce to defeat his avuncular nemesis.

  "One story says that this god's brother was the personification of the  dawn who was born 500 years prematurely than he was. This brother of  Aruna was so arrogant that Shiva one time used his thumb to smash this  god's head into the ground. The Mahabharata states that this figure sat  on a tree branch, nearly killing the valakhilyas.  This god, whose name  means \"bearer of great weight,\" was mistaken for (*) Agni at birth because  of his brightness. This man was badly beat by Indra when he was forced to  retrieve amrita  to help his mother Vinyata escape from the clutches of Kadru,  who is often held to be the mother of 1,000 serpents.
