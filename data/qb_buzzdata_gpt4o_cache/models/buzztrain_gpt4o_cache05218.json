  "A novel by this author is compared with Super-Cannes  by J.G. Ballard as one that describes the \"terrorism of the rich\" a theory formulated by Baudrillard. That novel's main protagonist is an intellectually challenged fashion supermodel and the son of a U.S. senator, Victor Johnson, who in one scene blows up a Caf\u00e9 with a bomb in a Prada bag. Along with that work Glamorama, Imperial Bedrooms  is the proposed sequel to his debut novel, which takes its title from an Elvis Costello song and is about Clay an underemployed, and educated twenty-something, a character trope that appears in a number of his works. Along with Less Than Zero, another novel that was made into a 2002  film follows the lives of some sexually promiscuous students at Camden College.

  "In this novel, Mortimer Lightwood is called to view a find made in the opening scene by a girl named Lizzie and her scavenging father, Gaffer, the rival of Rogue Riderhood. In the process, Lizzie starts making eyes with Eugene Wrayburn, creating a tangential love plot to the story of the protagonist, who seeks to reclaim his role as \"The Golden Dustman,\" which he lost after an assault by George Radfoot, whom he killed in self-defense. While the replacement heir, Noddy Boffin, is the target of a blackmail scheme by the one-legged Silas Wegg, the protagonist woos Bella Wilfer under a false name before reclaiming his true identity.

  "In this novel, the phrase \"Zeno of Elea\" is used as a code, and a character in this novel tells a story about the disguised Harun al-Rashid being chosen by lot to kill Harun al-Rashid. The protagonist of this work goes to see Uzzi-Tuzii, a professor of Bothno-Ugaric Languages and Literature, and another character in this work uses a spy-glass in his Swiss chalet to watch a woman reading. That character, the novelist Silas Flannery, is the target of (*) forgeries by supposed translator Ermes Marana. The protagonist encounters the sisters Lotaria and Ludmilla in this novel, whose narrative is interrupted by chapters like Without Fear of Wind or Vertigo and Outside the Town of Malbork. This work's first chapter opens with a discussion of how to deal with annoying people who watch tv in the next room while others are trying to read, and instructs \"relax\" and \"concentrate.\" FTP, identify this work whose main character is actually the Reader, a novel famously written substantially in the second person by Italo Calvino.": {

  "In this novel, the protagonist claims that the first of her ancestors to come to America was a fur-trader named Simon, while later on the protagonist's father says that the NRA was killed by nine old men. In one incident in this novel, Miss Maudie's house catches on fire, while in another, a man shoots and kills a rabid dog. In her school Halloween pageant, the protagonist dresses up as a (*) ham, which hinders her from running away from an attacker on the way back home. That attacker, Bob Ewell, succeeds in charging Tom Robinson of rape even though Atticus Finch's evidence proves him to be lying. For ten points, name this coming-of-age novel set in Maycomb, Alabama, in which Boo Radley befriends Scout Finch, a work of Harper Lee.": {
