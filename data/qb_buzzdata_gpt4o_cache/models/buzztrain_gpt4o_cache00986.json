  "In one corner of this work, a man offers up an apple to a bird he is balancing on his feet, while in another corner, a woman can be seen holding what looks like an oversized pear. This work also depicts a pair of ears placed together near a fire, and a man is held fast to an overturned table by a dagger pierced through his hand. In another part of this work, an enormous bird feeds a group of humans standing under a branch, and nearby a man is carrying a large mussel shell containing another man. More notably, a man with tree-like arms has a round disk on his head that carries a group of creatures, and Jesus holds the hand of Eve in the Garden of Eden.

  "His cosmology was a conjunction of the astronomy of Alpetragius and the chemistry of Paracelsus. In one of his early works, he compared his theories to a bee gathering honey, in contrast to a spider spinning a web. In that work he also attacked the work of Telesio, as an extension of earlier criticisms in On the Principles and Origins According to the Fables of Cupid and Coleum. In the second part of his most famous work he discussed his catalog of errors in human ideas, which are caused by \"the Cave\", \"the market-place,\" or \"the Tribe.\" These Idols were later expounded upon in The Advancement of Learning.
