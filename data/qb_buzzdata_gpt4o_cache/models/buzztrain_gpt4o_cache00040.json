  "The action of this is facilitated by an ylidic attack of a ketone group, resulting in a beta-alkoxide that is decarboxylated and deprotonated to form a thiamine heterocycle. It contains a core of lysine-bound lipoic acid \"arms\" that make up E2 di-hydro-lipoyl trans-acetylases, whose disulfide groups serve as acyl and electron carriers. This multimer contains an E3-bound flavin adenine dinucleotide which transfers protons from reduced lipoyl-lysine to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. It catalyzes irreversible oxidative decarboxylation, attaching the remaining hydroxyl-ethyl group to TPP in E1 before the lipoyl-lysine of E2 carries it to coenzyme A.

  "The action begins when the Duchess of Berwick convinces the title character to go through her husband's belongings, finding a number of suspicious checks. After a rash mistake, she accepts an invitation to potential adultery, but she is persuaded to not abandon her husband and child. Thus, she rebuffs Lord Darlington. When she returns, evidence of her impropriety remains, and the woman who dissuaded her, being her mother, sacrifices her recently regained social status for that of her daughter. In the end, Lord Augustus Lorton decides to marry the title character's mother, despite her reputation. The title object drops to the ground, and is not used to strike Mrs. Erlynne.

  "One actor in this story draws on the horrors of World War Two in decrying the punishment of people \"for walking round the world in the wrong skin.\" One messenger in this drama frequently proclaims that \"I only am escaped alone to tell thee,\" and also claims that witnesses also suffer. The protagonist of this play learns of his son being shot, two other children dying in a car wreck, and a fourth being raped.
