  "Among the infighting that beset this dynasty was a bitter feud between Queens Brunhilda and Fredegunde, while its lesser-known kings included Guntram and Sigebert I. Its later rulers where known as \"idle kings\", as all of its rulers after Dagobert I relinquished political control to Mayors of the Palace. This dynasty is typically dated back to the Battle of Soissons in 486, when Clovis defeated the last Roman ruler of Gaul, and it officially ended around 750 upon the ascension of Pepin the Short, the father of Charlemagne.

  "Among the experiments searching for these objects is the England-based SuperWASP project, which operates by continuously imaging the sky and detecting changes in brightness. They can be detected by pulsar timing experiments, as was done with PSR B1257+12 in 1992, while experiments such as the OGLE group employ gravitational lensing. Other satellites searching for them include the Darwin and Kepler missions, and the most common method of finding them is by measuring the Doppler shift which results from the gravitational influence on the stars they orbit.
