  "This effect, along with the Doppler effect, is utilized in telescopes such as NARVAL to map the magnetic fields of stars. In a Fabry-Perot interferometer, this effect can be used to measure the electron charge-mass ratio. In the weak field case, spin-orbit coupling occurs in conjunction with this, causing the angular momentum and spin to precess around the total angular momentum. In this case, the resulting energy is the product of the Bohr magneton, the Lande g-factor, the external field, and the z-component of the angular momentum. In the strong field, this is also known as the Paschen-Back effect, and its analogue for electric fields is the Stark effect. FTP, name this splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field.": {
