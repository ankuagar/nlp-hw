St. Martin's Abbey and the spire of St. Brice can be seen in a depiction of this man's army camp in a painting by Adam Fran van der Meulen, and his army is seen crossing the Rhine in a painting by Joseph Parrocel. His family surround him as mythological characters in a depiction by Jean Nocret and he was the subject of various busts and sculptures by Antoine Coysevox. His visits to Gobelins factory as well as his resolution of his war with the Dutch were painted by Charles Le Brun, who also painted this man's apotheosis.
