  "Members of this phylum are the vectors for the spread of Schistosomiasis. Free-swimming larvae of many species in this phylum are known as trocophores, which use cilia for propulsion until the development of a characteristic structure, and Eric Kandel won the Nobel prize for his studies of memory formation in Aplysia, which belongs to this organism. Members of this phylum possess an anterior buccal cavity containing an odontophore, which supports the main feeding structure, the radula. A true coelom and bilateral symmetry are common extant features of this phylum, while hemocyanin acts as an oxygen carrier in the hydrostatic skeleton. For 10 points, name this phylum with characteristic features like the visceral mass, head, and foot, encompassing such organisms as gastropods and cephalopods.": {
