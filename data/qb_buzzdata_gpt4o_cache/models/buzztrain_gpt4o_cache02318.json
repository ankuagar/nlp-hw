  "For gas phase reactions, this quantity is measured as the enthalpy of the transition state minus 2RT. A plot of the natural log of the rate constant versus the reciprocal of temperature gives a line with slope calculated to be this quantity divided by the gas constant. The enthalpy of reaction is the difference in this value for the forward and reverse reactions, and high values of this quantity make reaction rates more temperature-sensitive, as shown by the Arrhenius equation.
