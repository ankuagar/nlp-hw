  "If one parameter from this theory is considered to be temperature dependent, then the miscibility gaps in the G-phi diagrams are easily characterized. In this theory, molecules are said to become unperturbed at the theta temperature as they cannot feel the presence of other segments. Staverman's name is sometimes appended to this theory, and central to this theory is a quantity that approaches 1/2 for large molecules. That quantity is a function of the coordination number times lattice exchange energy. It assumes that the free energy of mixing can be completely described in entropic terms, as large molecules undergo ideal mixing. It is based on a lattice model in which each spacing is occupied by individual monomers and uses volume fractions rather than mole fractions. For 10 points, identify this theory which gives the thermodynamic properties of polymer solutions, that was developed by two American polymer chemists.": {
