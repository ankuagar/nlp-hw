  "The objects central to this statement are eigenfunctions of the family of operators from a space to the space of its modular forms: formally, this lemma guarantees the existence and analyticity of weight-two eigenforms of the aforementioned Hecke operators for non-singular third-order one-forms over the rationals whose solutions are confined to a torus. The discovery of a metric for the space of Galois representations revealed that this theorem posits an isomorphism between L-series of modular forms and the aforementioned curves; that idea arose from the object of the epsilon conjecture, Frey's curve, which was eventually shown to be modular. This theorem thus implies that every elliptic curve is a modular form.
