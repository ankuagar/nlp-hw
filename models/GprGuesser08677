  "This work features an atheist doctor who procures numerous books, including Amadis of Gaul, in an attempt to liberate the mind of a future curator of the Vatican Library. At one point in this novel, a family celebrates the Feast of Saint Ambrose, which is presided over by the de facto head of the household Dominga de Adviento. Later chapters include the escape of the insane Martina Laborde, and the recitation of Garcilaso de la Vega's sonnets in a cell. It is prefaced by a quote from Aquinas's \"On the Integrity of Resurrected Bodies,\" and a note by the author that details his inspection of a 200 year old tomb in Cartagena that revealed a corpse with still growing hair. It opens with the twelve year old daughter of the Marquis de Casalduero, a mulatto girl raised by slaves, being bitten by a rabid dog and subsequently sent to the Convent of Santa Clara. It ends with her dying after the secret passage, which once allowed her betrothed to visit, is closed.

  "This work's author uses the fact that wine can taste differently in the mouth of a sick man than it does in the mouth of a well man to contend that differing perceptions cannot both be true in a determinate reality. Later in this work, the author compares building up knowledge from first principles to the building of a house, using the sight of a dagger to represent knowledge of perception, and the idea that the dagger has ripped a couch to build to the highest level of knowledge, causal interactions. The subject of this work wrote that God had given man two books: the Bible and a metaphorical book of animals, Nature itself. This work was inspired by its author's reading of the tract Natural Theology or the Book of Creatures, written by the title Spanish theologian.

  "This work's first chapter observes that all thought is founded on a demand for order, and that unlike science, magic postulates a \"complete and all-embracing determinism.\" This book notes that the Warramunga prohibit paternal totems and that the Arabanna adopt the Aranda's kinship system for reincarnated spirits. This book claims that totemism results only from a necessary impulse toward distinguishing members of a larger group. Its section on \"The Science of the Concrete\" compares the title entity to a person who is ingenious but limited to using the objects and materials that he already has, referred to as a bricoleur, to be contrasted with the engineer.
