  "In a related calculation, aggregates and mid-point utilization can generate errors in the calculations of moments, thus one must use Sheppard's correction to West's Algorithm to determine this measure. The term used to describe this measure was coined in a lecture to the Royal Academy in 1893 by Karl Pearson, in which he derived this measure for several statistics, including the chi-squared test. In order to calculate this exactly one must know the corresponding distribution function, but in practical applications, it can be estimated from a sufficiently large sample size. Useful in determining confidence intervals, for 10 points, name this statistical measure the positive root of variance usually denoted with the lowercase Greek letter sigma.": {
