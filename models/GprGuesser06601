An example of the internal type of this effect is the longitudinal NMR in super- fluid helium. It allows a precise determination of the ratio e/h, and this effect can exist in AC and DC varieties. This basis for a SQUID can detect very small magnetic fields and was predicted by its namesake 22-year-old Brit. For 10 points, name this effect that can occur when a few nanometers thick layer of aluminum oxide separates two superconductors, which allows Cooper pairs to tunnel across the junction.": {
