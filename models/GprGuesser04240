Later works by this man incorporate twine woven around structures to effect a curved appearance, a technique he called \"stringing.\" A chemist friend of this man named John Sisson introduced him to perspex, which he used in many later works with a Spheric theme. He edited an art review with Leslie Martin and Ben Nicholson titled Circle, and he co-wrote a manifesto that affirmed depth as \"the pictoral and plastic form of space\" and the line as \"a direction of static forces.\" This man incorporated 1,500 jets of water into the design for a fountain that sits at the grounds of the St. Thomas Hospital in London. He emphasized the dissociation of mass from space in a principle he called stereometry, and sculpted Constructed Head No. 2 the kinetic Revolving Torsion: Fountain. With his brother Antoine, he laid down the tenets of a movement associated with Rodchenko and Tatlin.
