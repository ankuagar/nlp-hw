  "A legal doctrine with this name overturned Swift v. Tyson to mandate that federal courts use substantive state laws in some jurisdictions. One conflict with this name involved an enforced stop at the namesake location to sell peanut snacks. Another conflict with this name saw several men abscond to Fort Taylor, which they surrounded with policemen in rowboats as they attempted to bribe the Black Horse Cavalry. Daniel Drew was ruined in that conflict after watered-down shares were offered to hold off a (*) takeover attempt of the namesake company by Cornelius Vanderbilt. Another project with this name was inspired by the prison letters of Jesse Hawley and was finished by a \"marriage of the waters\" headed by DeWitt Clinton in 1825.
