  "Clifford algebras over Euclidean spaces are used to define the namesake objects of this property, which Lorentz transform according to relations involving commutators of gamma matrices.  Self-field interactions cause the proportionality between this value and its associated magnetic moment to differ from 2, a fact that implies QED must be used to calculate the electron gyromagnetic ratio.  One form of the operators for this observable is given by the Pauli matrices and it was Pauli who first proposed this property. Theorized by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck, FTP name this property that differentiates fermions and bosons, a form of intrinsic angular momentum, usually plus or minus one half for an electron.": {
