Derivatization with this element has largely replaced using bromine to introduce anomalous scattering properties to nucleic acids for MAD phasing. The 3-prime UTRs of many proteins that associate with this element contain a K-turn motif with many conserved guanine-adenine base pairs. This element's dioxide oxidizes the alpha position of carbonyls to produce 1,2-diketones and regioselectively oxidizes alkenes to allylic alcohols. Cadmium bonds to this element in the most common quantum dots. Electron exchange in the active sites of glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase is accomplished by this element, which can be ingested in toxic amounts through excessive": {
