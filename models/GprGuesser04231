  "When labelled, these objects can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with Pruefer sequences. A well-known algorithm due to Tarjan finds lowest common ancestors in them. Along with Sleator, Tarjan also developed one type of these objects that is self-organizing, while another variety of these objects assigns a (*) colour to each node. In addition to the \"splay\" and \"red-black\" varieties, balanced varieties of these objects can be used for \"symbol table\" or \"dictionary\" data structures in many programming language standard libraries. Their conventional depiction on paper shows they are upside-down relative to the real-world objects after which they are named. For 10 points, name these connected acyclic graphs, which contain leaves and sometimes roots, collections of which are known as forests.": {
