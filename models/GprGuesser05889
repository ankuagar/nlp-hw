  "This piece's third movement is in a rondo form, and ends with a tarantella. The first movement of this piece transitions from major to minor, and is a Presto with a notably difficult piano part which matches the solo instrument. Although this piece was originally dedicated to George Bridgetower, it received its new name from the performer it was rededicated to. The last movement of this piece is in 6/8 time and is described as exuberant, while it ends in A major. The second movement of this sonata is notably long because it states a theme and then moves through five distinct variations, transitioning into F in the process. This piece of music inspired and titled a novella by Leo Tolstoy. For ten points, identify this extremely long violin sonata, the Opus 47 of Ludwig von Beethoven.": {
