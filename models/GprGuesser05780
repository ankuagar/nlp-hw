The tempo marking \"Allegro ritmato e deciso\" is appended to the first and third of three works of this kind by George Gershwin, which Jascha Heifetz transcribed for the violin. A J.S. Bach piece of this type is the basis for Charles Gounod's \"Ave Maria\". One of these pieces nicknamed \"The Bells of Moscow\" is a work in (*) C-sharp minor by Rachmaninoff. Chopin wrote 24 pieces in this genre, arranged according to the circle of fifths, the most famous of which is the one in D-flat nicknamed \"Raindrop\". In The Well-Tempered Clavier, these pieces are paired with fugues. For 10 points, name these pieces, whose name suggests their function as introductions.": {
