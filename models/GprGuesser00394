  "Based on the lengths of these structures, some cells are classified as Golgi One or Golgi Two. The  \uf0d9  A delta  and polymodal C  types of these structures transmit signals from nociceptors. A lack of  protection for these structures can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. This part of some cells has branches  \uf0da called telodendria. Much of this structure is surrounded by cells that produce an insulating material,  and the gaps where this structure is not surrounded are called the nodes of Ranvier [ran-vee-ay]. The  other parts are protected by Schwann cells that produce myelin. Name these extensions from nerve  cells that send signals to dendrites.": {
