  "By general consensus the most important critique of this philosophical work is Robert Nozick's \"Anarchy, State and Utopia\". The author's conception of the \"veil of ignorance\" is discussed in this work popularly known as the \"green monster\", which claims to examine \"the grounds of ethical knowledge\". It begins by reviving the idea of a social contract, then goes on to conclude that, unless the least advantaged group in a society is benefited, there is no justification for anyone in a society to be better off than anyone else.
