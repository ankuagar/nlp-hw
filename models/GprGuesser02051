That essay, along with others like one concerned with the pernicious influence of fascism, were collected in Between Philosophy and Social Science. One of his most important works contains sections such as \"Means and Ends\" and \"Conflicting Panaceas;\" those sections discuss distinctions between subjective, objective, and instrumental versions of the title concept, with emphasis on how the Nazis applied it. Along with another writer, this author of The Authoritarian State and The Eclipse of Reason wrote a work which contained two Excurses on Odysseus and Juliette and a discussion of anti-Semitism, in addition to an exposition of what he called the \"culture industry.\" FTP, name this man who wrote The Dialectic of Enlightenment with Theodor Adorno.": {
