  "Taking the curl of the static member of this set yields a Helmholtz equation for one of the governed quantities with a constant equal in cgs units to minus four pi carrier density fundamental charge squared over electron rest energy. This set of equations can be reduced to the single equation minus speed of light, carrier density, fundamental charge squared over electron rest energy all times vector potential equals current density, but only in the Coulomb gauge, which is the same as these equations' namesake gauge. The aforementioned Helmholtz equation constant is the inverse square of a quantity that gives the e-folding distance of external fields, that being the (*) penetration depth named for these equations. For 10 points, name this pair of equations that give the electromagnetic fields in a type-one superconductor in terms of phenomenological variables.": {
