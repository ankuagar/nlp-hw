  "The term gekokujo, translated as \"the low oppressing the high,\" was coined during this conflict to describe the victory of peasant mobs. The leader of the Ouchi Clan was forced to destroy his own house in Kyoto at the conclusion of this conflict. This conflict disrupted the construction of the Ginkaku-ji, a pavilion whose original plans called for a covering of silver foil. The Yamana clan was outlawed and defeated during this conflict. As a result of this conflict, the Hosokawa Clan became de-facto rulers of Japan. The Ikko-Ikki Warrior Monks were founded during this conflict. This conflict centered on whether a monk or an infant should become the next shogun and was fought between daimyo that supported each side.
