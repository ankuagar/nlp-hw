A sword is hanging from the belt of a figure sitting at a table who faces backward, while the figures on the left wear contemporary garb and the two men on the right wear cloaks. This painting features three sources of light including an oilskin-covered window, as well as a bearded figure whose left hand is pointing at his own chest while his right hand is on a coin.
