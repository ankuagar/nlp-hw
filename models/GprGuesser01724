  "This empire's second ruler was known as Amitrochates to the Greeks. Its founder was advised by the author of a manual discussing government as \"the science of punishment\" and advocating the establishment of spy networks. Its namesake polish can be seen on many sandstone sculptures, including the lion capital at Sarnath. It fell apart with the rise to power of the Sunga dynasty about 500 years after supplanting the Nanda dynasty of Maghada. Following the death of the second ruler, Bindusara, the third ruler conquered Kalinga before converting to Buddhism and ordering the carving of the Rock Edicts.

  "This man employed Mascezel to quell a revolt that occurred when Mascezel's brother Gildo seized control of African grain ships, forcing this man to direct that grain be imported from Gaul and Spain. Early in life, he served as an envoy at the court of Shapur III, where he negotiated a treaty on the partition of Armenia. A triumphal arch was erected after this man defeated Radagaisus. Shortly afterward, he allegedly ordered the burning of the Sibylline Books to prevent their prophecies from interfering with his campaigns. After his victory at the Battle of Pollentia, his son Eucherius became involved in a conspiracy hatched by the palace official Olympius, leading them both to be decapitated. The poet Claudian wrote poems for this man, who married Serena, the niece of Theodosius, and was appointed regent for the emperor Honorius.
