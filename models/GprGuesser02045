  "One figure by this name was the wife of Corythus on the island of Samothrace - she reportedly took refuge under the Palladium after being raped by Zeus, but Athena grew angry and flung the Palladium to earth, where this figure gave it to her son Dardanus. Another figure of this name has her speech often compared to a nightingale's song, and she mocks the corpse of a man murdered mid-sacrifice, stating \"May I never have a husband with a girl's face, but one with a man's ways.\" She identifies a scar on the brow of another character as caused by chasing a fawn in his youth. She attempts to convince her sister Chrysothemis to work with her, but gets warned that Aegisthus is planning to imprison her.
