  "Facio-scapulo-humeral dystrophy is believed to be caused by these structures' namesake position effect, \u00a0which Baur et al showed could be relieved by Trichostatin A. Their size can be assayed via Flo-FISH or a TRF southern blot, and they are protected from non-homologous end-joining by the shelterin complex.
