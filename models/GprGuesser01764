Eliot's Family Reunion, which are followed by a prologue where Louis Armstrong's \"What Did I Do To Be So Black and Blue?\" makes the narrator imagine a church-like cave.  Its narrator meets Supercargo and a nihilistic vet at the Golden Day, where he takes Mr. Norton to recover after hearing the story of the incestuous Truebloods.
