  "In engineering, the Newton number is defined as this quantity over density times rotational speed cubed times stirred diameter to the fifth. The integral of the Poynting vector over an exposed surface has units of this quantity, which can be used to show that it equals two-third times charge squared times acceleration squared over the speed of light cubed. The \"reactive\" form of this quantity in an AC circuit, caused by a nonzero phase angle, is measured in (*) volt-amps. The pump head times the volumetric flow rate equals this quantity.
