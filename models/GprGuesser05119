A 1924 Carney Landis experiment best remembered for its two thirds of its subject's willingness to decapitate rats intended to match facial expressions to this. An experiment in which an attractive confederate gave out phone numbers on a rickety bridge and a safe bridge backed up the findings of an experiment in which subjects who thought they were receiving the fictional eyesight improving drug Superoxin actually got a dose of adrenalin. That experiment was conducted by Schachter and Singer and led to a model in which physiology and cognition cause these phenomena, the \"two factor theory.\" For 10 points name these phenomena that include euphoria and guilt.": {
