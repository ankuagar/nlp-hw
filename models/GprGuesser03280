  "Before the introduction of this program, a commission known as Gosplan was created for coordination. Some historians have suggested that it was formulated years earlier than its implementation in an essay entitled \"Six Theses on the Immediate Tasks.\" It created an imbalance in wealth that led to the so-called Scissors Crisis, and it shares its name with an unrelated policy adopted by Malaysia in 1971. Much of the impetus for it came in the Kronstadt Rebellion, which demanded an end to War Communism, but it was itself abandoned after the Grain Crisis of 1928 by Stalin.
