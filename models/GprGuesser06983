  "One section of this poem discusses grass that \"grew as scant as hair / in leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud / Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.\" The speaker asserts \"I never saw a brute I hated so / He must be wicked to deserve such pain\" after encountering an emaciated blind horse, and claims \"I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart,\" reflecting on the fate of his deceased friends Cuthbert and Giles. The third to last stanza, begins with the question \"Not See?\" and describes how the \"day / came back again\" to illuminate hills \"like giants\"; while the penultimate stanza begins with the question \"Not Hear?\" The speaker receives directions from \"that hoary cripple, with malicious eye\" and, after traveling through a barren valley, reaches the title location and claims \"Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set / and blew.\" This poem was first published in the collection Men and Women, and inspired by Edgar's mad song in King Lear.

  "The second movement of a concerto for this instrument was reconstructed in 2003 by Jos van der Zanden and Cees Nieuwen- huizen. In the second movement of another concerto for this instrument, before the last two measures the accompaniment consists entirely of sixteenth notes in the first violin and eighth notes in the rest of the non-soloist parts. Another concerto for this instrument features an andante spiccato opening movement and a second movement adagio that was transcribed for harpsichord by J.S. Bach. In Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestral arrangement of Polovetsian Dances, this instrument introduces the theme of the first dance. Concerti in D minor for this instrument were written by Alessandro Marcello and Tomaso Albinoni. A similar instrument lacks this instrument's low B flat key but otherwise has the same fingerings and is pitched a fifth lower; that instrument is the English horn. For 10 points, name this double reed woodwind instrument that plays the tuning note before orchestra performances.": {
