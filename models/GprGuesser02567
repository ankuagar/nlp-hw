  "One of this group's possessions, Head no. 58, was rumored to be that of St. Ursula's. Peter the Veneable convinced Humbert of Beaujeu to leave this group and devoted himself to the Church of Burgundy. This group was the subject of Bernard of Clairvaux's De laude novae militiae. This group established a base on Ruad in 1301 but were soon expelled. Men who had formerly been a part of this group were used to form the Order of Montesa. This group was suppressed by the Council of Vienne but they were originally recognized by the Council of Troyes. For a fee, this group allowed travelers to deposit money at the start of their journey and get it back at their destination. This group was founded by Hugh of Payns.
