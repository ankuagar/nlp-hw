  "Walter Baade was so pissed at Rudolph Minkowski for dissing his theory about this process occurring in Cygnus A that he bet $1,000, then a case of whiskey, and finally a bottle of whiskey, that he was right about it. Groundbreaking simulations of this process by Toomre & Toomre showed the presence of tidal tails. The blue ring-shaped rim around the Cartwheel formation resulted from this process creating a compressional wave that is driving intense star formation. The best evidence for dark matter is provided by an example of it in the (*) Bullet Cluster. The distinctive shape of the Mice and Antennae galaxies is due to them undergoing this process. For 10 points, name this type of astronomical event that will occur in four billionty years between the Milky Way and Andromeda.": {
