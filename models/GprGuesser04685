This act takes its name from a three volume work on communicating with  supernatural beings by Trithemius. OpenPuff is a program for doing the \"deniable\" form of this practice  using many different file formats. This practice is similar to Rivest's chaffing and winnowing, but unlike c&w  the adversary in this case will not know this is happening. One physical way to do this is microdots.
