He adopted G.E.M. Anscombe's idea of \"under a description\" in his first major publication, which argued that certain behaviors may be understood as intentional or unintentional depending on the context. That work, \"Actions, Reasons, and Causes,\" was completed after his Decision-Making: An Experimental Approach. His works deployed what he called \"radical interpretation,\" which focuses on how human beings understand language from scratch.
