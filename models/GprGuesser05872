Diabetes (*) insipidus can result from underproduction of one substance in this organ, which can cause acromegaly when it overproduces growth hormone. The anterior portion of this organ produces ACTH and FSH, and the posterior portion produces oxytocin. For 10 points, name this endocrine gland situated under the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, often described as the \"master gland.\"": {
