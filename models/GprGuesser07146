In addition to that type named for Mie, another type of this process occurs when there are time-dependent density variations in a material, and is named for Brillouin. If x-rays undergo this process and speed up, this process is named after Sunyaev and Zeldovich, and if the x-rays slow, it is named after Compton. When this happens to a photon inelastically, it is named after Raman. For 10 points, name this process, the Rayleigh type of which explains why the sky is blue.": {
