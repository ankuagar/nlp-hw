  "David Rosen inexplicably replaced a dark sky with a gold one in one of the two depictions of this scene by Rogier van der Weyden, both of which include a red cloth draped behind their central figure. The sun and the moon appear together at the top of a depiction of this scene in which two angels holding chalices flank its central figure. A version of this scene in the style of \"nuclear mysticism\" is set above the bay of Port Lligat and includes the polyhedron net of a hypercube. Another depiction of this scene clothes its central figure in a prayer shawl and includes a man in green fleeing a burning synagogue to emphasize its central figure's relation to 20th-century Jews. Raphael's depiction of this scene is named for Ludwig Mond, while Marc Chagall's is called \"white\".
