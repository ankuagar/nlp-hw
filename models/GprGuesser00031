  "According to one account, this man planted 84 mulberry trees to feed silkworms after reading a manual on the subject, and he hosted a group at his home known as \"Chiquita Francia\" because they studied French books. Known as \"El Zorro\" or the \"Fox\" for his cunning, he met his end at the \"Wells of Baja\u0301n\" after he was tricked into believing a shipment of weapons was there for him to take. His key victory over general Torcuato Trujillo at \"Monte de Las Cruces\" is now commemorated by La Marquesa National Park. After meeting at Charo, he directed his subordinate Jose\u0301 Morelos to raise troops on the southern coast.
