  "Measurements of this phenomenon allow one to calculate the mass of a white dwarf without the mass-radius relation. The Galileo spacecraft used an ultrastable crystal oscillator to detect this phenomenon. R. F. C. Vessot measured it using a rocket-bound hydrogen maser and confirmed predictions by one part in ten thousand. R. K. (*) Sachs and A. M. Wolfe showed that large- scale fluctuations in cosmic density should lead to different values of this for observed microwave photons. Stellar masses have attempted to be deduced through measurements of it, but adjustments for pressure shifts and proper application of the Doppler Effect create large uncertainties.
