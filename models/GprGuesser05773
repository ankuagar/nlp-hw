  "One painter from this movement produced a poster based on the Last Supper with himself in place of Jesus, and produced a parody titled Cardinal and Nun. The official magazine of this movement, Ver Sacrum, was illustrated by its co-founder Koloman Moser. One of this movement's exhibitions featured a painting in which a gigantic furry brown monster represents Typhon. Oskar Kokoschka learned from the leaders of this movement, possibly absorbing the disturbingly erotic output of Egon Schiele. Its leader liberally used gold-leaf in paintings such as Danae and his mosaic-like depiction of an embracing couple.

  "This painting is bookended on each side by maroon chairs with tassles and gold studs.  The image on the wall in this painting is, as in many other works by its artist, labeled with the word \"Descriptio,\" its creators being known as \"World Describers.  The lack of candles in the golden chandelier adorned with a double-headed eagle in this work is likely a reference to the suppression of the painter's faith.  A large tapestry serves as a repoussoir, held back by the chair on the left. Black and white tile belies this painting's meager setting and led to its misidentification as a work of Peter de Hooch. One figure, wearing a poofy black and white slashed doublet, has his back to the viewer and rests his right arm on a maulstick, while the other figure wears holds a book and a trumpet in the guise of Clio.
