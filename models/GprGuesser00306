He is best known for a novel in which an investigator arrives in Fairvale to look for $40,000 stolen by Sam Loomis' girlfriend but is murdered by the same character who murdered her. That character is eventually revealed to suffer from a split personality which resulted in him dressing up as his mother.

  "An author of this name is credited with such no-longer-extant tragedies as The Sentinels and Mega Drama, as well as the philosophical work Triagmos. In a work by this name, one character successfully avoids death by identifying a golden snake bauble, a still-fresh circlet of olive branches, and a woven cloth with a Gorgon on it. That play of this name opens with a prologue from Hermes and sees a plot revealed when a flock of doves die after drinking from the title figure's wineglass, which had been poisoned with Gorgon blood. This play's title character is (*) adopted after the prophet Trophonius convinces the title character's adoptive father that he won't leave Delphi without a child, and the dea ex machina ending sees Athena convince that title character and his mother not to reveal his true parentage to Xuthus.
