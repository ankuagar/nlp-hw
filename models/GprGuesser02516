  "He was a god of grain and agriculture worshipped by the Amorites, Eblans, and Ugaritic peoples, for whom his name also meant grain. Sanchuniathon reports that his name means siton, the Greek word for grain,* and claims that after he discovered agriculture, he was worshipped as Zeus Arotrios. He was occasionally equated with Enlil by the Sumerians and was mentioned in Hammurabi's Code. Rashi, an 11th Century Rabbi, posits that he was part fish, a tradition which was used by Milton in Paradise Lost. FTP, name this god, the chief deity of the Biblical Philistines.": {
