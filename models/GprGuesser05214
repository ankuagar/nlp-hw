  "The non-Biblical figures in this painting, one of whom is in the costume of a gonfaloniere, are possibly kneeling portraits of the Lenzi family. Because of its impressive architecture - such as the incorporation of a chapel behind God - many scholars believe that Filippo Brunelleschi helped its artist make this painting. When Giorgio Vasari was commissioned to restore the Santa Maria Novella's paintings, he chose to leave this one alone due to its perfection. Unusually, Mary gazes emotionlessly and directly at the viewer while dispassionately pointing toward her son. To the right of her is John the Baptist. At the bottom of this fresco, the phrase \"I was once that which you are, and what I am you will also be\" appears above a cadaver tomb.
