  "Retired Admiral Ben Moreell claimed this event was unnecessary because certain companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. A non Secretary of Defense named Charles Wilson resigned during this event after criticizing the Wage Stabilization Board's recommendations. The New York Daily News said the President did \"a Hitler\" in response to it, and that response to this event ended in a \"stinging rebuff\" to the President when John W. Davis' arguments were accepted by a Hugo Black led majority. It ended shortly after the U.S. Army was forced to shut down its largest shell-making plant, a serious blow to the Korean War effort. The President's attempt to foil this event by nationalizing an industry was ended by the Supreme Court's decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer.
