  "Using electrostatic interactions known as Circe effects, systems modeled by this equation that exhibit \"kinetic perfection\" can overcome diffusion-based limitations. When this equation is applied empirically to microbial growth, it is known as the Monod equation. It can be derived either by assuming that the reactants immediately equilibrate to form the intermediate complex which decays irreversibly into product, or equivalently by applying a steady-state approximation to that intermediate's concentration. The reactant concentration at which the reaction rate is half of V-max is given by this equation's constant, K-sub-m; both V-max and K-sub-m can be read off of a Lineweaver-Burke plot. For": {
