  "Photographer David Seymour showed this work's creator underneath its depiction of a woman who raises her hands in agony. An arm holds a lamp at its center next to a light bulb in the shape of an eye. A bull stands over a woman holding her dead child on its left side. A reproduction of this work located at the U.N. headquarters was covered by a curtain in 2003 in order to hide such images as a man with a broken sword being trampled by a Cubist horse. Commissioned for the 1937 World's Fair, this work shows the horrors of the Nazi-bombing of a certain Basque city. For 10 points, name this painting": {
